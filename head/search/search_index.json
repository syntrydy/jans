There are many ways you can contribute. Of course you can contribute code. But we also need people to write documentation and guides, to help us with testing, to answer questions on the forums and chat, to review PR's, to help us with devops and CI/CD, to provide feedback on usability, and to promote the project through outreach. Also, by sharing metrics with us, we can gain valuable insights into how the software performs in the wild. Join the Community First Time Contributors Contribution Guidelines Code of Conduct About Issues Triaging Code Conventions and Guidelines Commits Branches PRs Issues Contributing to the documentation Contribution Workflow Find Something To Work On Start a Discussion Implement the Change Document Raise a PR Follow Through Join the Community # Repo : Watch and Star Janssen repository on Github Discussions : Join interesting discussions at Github Discussions Chat : We have an active community chat on Gitter . You can register for free their with your Github identity. Tweet : Janssen is on Twitter too. Follow us there to stay up to date on release announcements and news around Janssen. First Time Contributors # In case you are first-time contributor, then you can start with our good first issues list These are issues where you can easily contribute and community members will guide and support your contribution as always. If you need Janssen installation to test out your fix, here are the steps . Contribution Guidelines # We are really glad you are reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition. Code of Conduct Issues Triaging Coding Conventions Code of Conduct # Janssen project has a Code of Conduct to which all contributors must adhere, please read it before interacting with the repository or the community in any way. About Issues # There are four kinds of issues you can open: Bug report : you believe you found a problem in a project and you want to discuss and get it fixed, creating an issue with the bug report template is the best way to do so. Feature Request : any kind of new feature need to be discussed in this kind of issue, do you want a new rule or a new feature? This is the kind of issue you want to open. Be very good at explaining your intent, it's always important that others can understand what you mean in order to discuss, be open and collaborative in letting others help you getting this done! Security Vulnerability : If you identify a security problem, please report it immediately, providing details about the nature, and if applicable, how to reproduce it. If you want to report an issue privately, you can email security@gluu.org Failing tests : you noticed a flaky test or a problem with a build? This is the kind of issue to triage that! The best way to get involved in the project is through issues, you can help in many ways: Issues triaging: participating in the discussion and adding details to open issues is always a good thing, sometimes issues need to be verified, you could be the one writing a test case to fix a bug! Fix an issue: you can help in getting issue fixed in many ways. More often by opening a pull request. In case you are first-time contributor, then you can start with our good first issues list These are issues where you can easily contribute and community members will guide and support your contribution as always. Triaging # Triage is a process of evaluating issues and PRs in order to determine their characteristics and take quick actions if possible. When you triage an issue, you: assess whether it has merit or not quickly close it by correctly answering a question point the reporter to a resource or documentation answering the issue tag it via labels, projects, or milestones take ownership submitting a PR for it, in case you want \ud83d\ude07 Here is how we continously triage new issues and PRs so that contributors can contribute faster and better. Code Conventions and Guidelines # Commits # Janssen Project mandates all commits to follow guidelines as below. Commit messages As commit convention, we adopt Conventional Commits v1.0.0 , we have an history of commits that do not adopt the convention but any new commit must follow it to be eligible for merge. Add GPG signature to your commit To ensure that contribution is coming for a trusted source, all commits should be signed using GPG key and verified by Github. If you have GPG key setup already then just use -S switch with you commit to sign it. If you need to setup your GPG key and verification, then you can find detailed instructions here Add DCO sign-off The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Contributors to the Janssen project sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages. This is a commit message Signed-off-by: Foo Bar <foobar@spam.org> Git even has a -s command line option to append this automatically to your commit message: $ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message' In all, if you have your GPG verification setup, your commit command should look like git commit -S -s -m 'message that follows conventional commit style' Branches # Branch name should have component name as prefix, eg jans-core-mybranch PRs # PR titles should also follow Conventional Commits v1.0.0 . This will help in keeping merge commit messages inline with commit message standards Squash commits into small number of cohesive commits before raising a PR PR should be rebased on main branch so that there are minimal or no conflicts at the time of merge PR should only have changes related to target feature or issue. Create a separate PR for formatting or other quick bug fixes PR should include relevent documentaton changes PR should include unit and integration tests Issues # Issue titles should follow Conventional Commits v1.0.0 Backport changes to a different version # Backport changes are now supported through a workflow through labels prefixed with backport/ . For-example to backport changes in a certain PR to version v1.0.0 a label to that PR matching the version must be added i.e backport/v1.0.0 . The flow consists of creating a new branch, cherry-picking the changes of the original PR and creating a new PR to merge them. Contributing to the documentation # Great documentation is a reflection of software's maturity and the great community that stands behind it. Contributing to the Janssen Project documentation is the easiest way to learn about the Janssen Project and to get involved in the community process. In order to ensure consistency of style, language, format, and terminology across all documents, please follow the guidelines below: Glossary of terms # This glossary helps to keep terms and their meanings consistent across documentation. Janssen Project or Jans : Refers to the official project name under Linux Foundation that seeks to build the world\u2019s fastest and most comprehensive cloud native identity and access management software platform Janssen Server : Refers to a set of software components developed under the Janssen Project . Components of the Janssen Server include client and server implementations of the OAuth, OpenID Connect, SCIM and FIDO standards. The term Janssen Server is used to refer to these components as a group. jans-auth-server : Refers to a module within the Janssen Server named jans-auth-server . This is one of the significant modules of the Janssen Server that has an implementation for OAuth and OpenId Connect. Janssen Server module names: For correct naming of other modules of the Janssen Server, please refer to README Documentation Style Guide # Janssen Project documentation uses Markdown. Guidelines below are intended to bring consistency in writing and formatting documents. Testing Janssen Project documentation site is published using MkDocs. Markdown parsers used by Github and the one used by MkDocs may have slight variations in how they generate HTML. So, for a small number of cases, document may look different between Github and Janssen Project documentation site . Hence it is critical to test documentation changes locally before pushing to repository. This will ensure that final HTML rendering of documents by MkDocs is as desired. General Text # Allow long lines to wrap, rather than manually breaking them. For example, the Introduction paragraph is a single line Keep explanations short and clear Use complete sentences when possible To make text italicised , put an _ on each side, like this: _word_ To bold text, put a double * on each end, like this: **word** Leave a blank line between paragraphs. Count a header as a paragraph for this purpose Avoid passive voice as much as possible. It's clearer to say that a subject does something than to say a result was done Avoid using you in statements as much as possible. For example, instead of saying You can navigate to... simply say Navigate to... Page Setup # Start your page with a title on the first line Follow with a concise overview of the document / product's purpose Organize the information in the document from least technical to most technical if possible. Start conceptual, then get detailed Lists # Leave a blank line between text and first item in the list Only use a numbered list if the order of the list matters A line of a list should not end with a period. If it's multiple sentences, like this one, drop the last period Start each item in the list with a capital letter End each item in the list with at least three spaces. This makes sure the line breaks properly To make a bulleted list, start each line with - To make a numbered list, start each line with 1. For example: 1. This is the first item 1. This is the second item 1. This is the third item It will look like this: 1. This is the first item 2. This is the second item 3. This is the third item To include additional lines in a list item, start the sub-line with four spaces. For example: 1. This is the first item in a list There are four spaces to start this line Another four spaces here This keeps all text inside the numbered list item, before starting... 1. The following list item It will look like this: This is the first item in a list There are four spaces to start this line Another four spaces here This keeps all text inside the list, before starting... The following list item Other formatting considerations # Admonitions cannot be nested inside a list. They must be aligned all the way left. Inserting them within a list will break the list sequence (starting back over from 1). Nesting a fenced block of code in a numbered list is more challenging, as the list and code block syntaxes clash. To nest a code block into a list, insert four spaces to the left of all lines of the formatting. For example: 1. This is the first item ``` This is code This is also code. ``` 1. This is the second item It will look like this: This is the first item This is code This is also code. This is the second item Headings # Headings should be in title format. All important words should be capitalized The main title of the page should start with a single # , then each level of subheading should add one. For example, the first subheading should start with ## , a subheading of that should use ### , and so on Code Formatting # To format text as code within a line of normal text, surround the code with a single backtick (`). If the code is to be on its own line, it should be a fenced code block. To make a fenced code block, make a line before and after the code with three backticks: ``` This is code ``` We use the SuperFences plugin to enhance this functionality. Examples & Navigation # When possible, provide an example in the form of code output or a screenshot To instruct a user to click a button, or navigate to a certain page or through a menu, use the following style: Navigate to `Configuration` > `Authentication` and click the `Passport` tab It will look like this: Navigate to Configuration > Authentication and click the Passport tab Linking # We recommend using relative linking syntax when linking to other artifacts in repository. Linking to a page within the same repo use this format: [text for the link](../where/the/link/goes.md) - You must link to the .md file on GitHub for it to work properly - As an example, to make text this link link to a Markdown document named example.md in the same directory, you'd type it as [this link](./example.md) Service Commands # The Janssen Server supports many different Operating Systems (e.g. Ubuntu, SUSE etc.). Service commands can vary. Rather than \"hard coding\" service commands into documentation, please instead reference the dedicated documentation page for Service Commands . In documenting a process that involves a service restart, the Service Command documentation is linked: ## Add the attribute to LDAP - Add custom attribute - [Restart](https://jans.io/docs/vm-ops/restarting-services/) the `jans-auth.service` service. The word Restart is simply linked to the dedicated doc for Service Commands. Tables # Try to make tables visually readable by spacing to make distinct columns The header for each column must be separated by at least three dashes Use outer pipes for consistency If an entry is too long to fit in the neat boxes, that's fine, just try to keep it legible An example table follows: |This |Is |A |Table | |--------|-------|------|---------| |1 |2 |3 |4 | |Word |Code |Text |Table | It looks like this: This Is A Table 1 2 3 4 Word Code Text Table Help On Technical Writing # It is essential for everyone in the community to actively participate in the documentation. At the same time, not everyone is formally trained or experienced in writing technical documents. To help everyone understand the basics of good technical writing, we have listed a few resources below. Going through these resources will not take a lot of time and will help in writing better technical documents. Introduction to Technical Writing (part-1) Introduction to Technical Writing (part-2) Contribution Workflow # Find something to work on # Best place to find something to work on is to look at currently open issues . If you are a first time contributor then starting with list of good first issues is best. Start a discussion # Start a Github Discussion about what you are planning to contribute. Explain the feature or issue that you are planning to contribute and what your solution or implementation approach. Janssen is a community driven project and it'll be helpful to get community's view about it. Create an issue # Take your time to write a proper issue including a good summary and description. Outcome of Github discussion about your contribution can help you create good content for the issue. As a first step when creating a new issue, an issue template has to be selected. Select appropriate issue template and it'll help you create an issue with right content. Remember that issue may be the first thing a reviewer of your PR will look at to get an idea of what you are proposing. It will also be used by the community in the future to find about what new features and enhancements are included in new releases. Implement the change # All contributions to Janssen Project should be made via Github pull requests(PR). New to PR workflow?? Learn and practice it at first-contributions Create a Fork # Fork Janssen repository . And create a clone. Implement the Change # Start working on changes as required. Make sure the code conventions are being followed. Use static code analysis and linting tools to make sure the code is high-quality. Write tests first and then code. Ensure that integration tests that cover your code are appropriately updated and reviewed. Create PR early and push often. Janssen uses Github actions to run automated checks on PR changes. Ensure that these checks are passing with every push. Engage PR reviewers at the start so that they can continue to reivew code as it is developed and in small chunks. For a change that is non-trivial(an enhancement or a new feature), design should be reviewed. This should be done via PR by adding appropriate code owners. Document # PR should include changes in relevant documentation along with code changes. PR is checked by bot to have either one of the following : A commit that follows commit guidelines with docs: message Changes in artifacts under jans/docs If PR does not need any documentation changes, then the developer needs to acknowledge that in one of two ways: Add an empty commit to the PR (using --allow-empty git flag) with docs: message (i.e docs: no doc changes required ) Add footer to the commit message of one of the code commits with docs: message e.g fix: typo on class name More details here. docs: no docs modification Raise a PR # Make sure that PR title follows these guidelines Janssen uses Github PR template. Template provides helpful instructions to ensure new PRs are complete in details and easy to review. Github will populate new PR's description with these instructions. You can edit PR description as per your requirements. When PR is raised, Github will automatically assign reviewer to the PR based changed files and CODEOWNERS list. Once PR is raised, ensure that PR passes all the mandatory Github actions checks available on Github PR page. Github will not allow PR to be merged if any of the mandatory check is failing. Follow Through # Once the PR is raised, wait for reviewers to start review. Reviewers will start review at the first opportunity available. If you want to draw attention, give a gentle reminder in PR comments. But please be patient. Follow activities on your PR closely till the time PR is merged. PR reviewer may want to suggest a change or may need to ask a question to get more clarity. Make sure you are actively collaborating. Once Reviewer has completed the review and approved the changes, the PR will be merged. Thats it!!

Feature Request : any kind of new feature need to be discussed in this kind of issue, do you want a new rule or a new feature? This is the kind of issue you want to open. Be very good at explaining your intent, it's always important that others can understand what you mean in order to discuss, be open and collaborative in letting others help you getting this done! Security Vulnerability : If you identify a security problem, please report it immediately, providing details about the nature, and if applicable, how to reproduce it. If you want to report an issue privately, you can email security@gluu.org Failing tests : you noticed a flaky test or a problem with a build? This is the kind of issue to triage that! The best way to get involved in the project is through issues, you can help in many ways: Issues triaging: participating in the discussion and adding details to open issues is always a good thing, sometimes issues need to be verified, you could be the one writing a test case to fix a bug!

Add GPG signature to your commit To ensure that contribution is coming for a trusted source, all commits should be signed using GPG key and verified by Github. If you have GPG key setup already then just use -S switch with you commit to sign it. If you need to setup your GPG key and verification, then you can find detailed instructions here Add DCO sign-off The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Contributors to the Janssen project sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages. This is a commit message Signed-off-by: Foo Bar <foobar@spam.org> Git even has a -s command line option to append this automatically to your commit message: $ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message' In all, if you have your GPG verification setup, your commit command should look like git commit -S -s -m 'message that follows conventional commit style'","title":"Commits"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#branches","text":"Branch name should have component name as prefix, eg jans-core-mybranch","title":"Branches"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#prs","text":"PR titles should also follow Conventional Commits v1.0.0 .

Many SSO solutions offer a proprietary endpoint to accomplish this. However, in Janssen server, this is accomplished with the OAuth/OpenID framework by using a combination of calling the /token endpoint using the OAuth password flow, and then redirecting to browser to the /authorization endpoint, but auto-submitting the form. This article describes how to process login via backchannel and when browser is processing authorization, AS will recognize automatically the authenticated user, write cookies and then establish the session. Design # Source-code for sequence diagram Title password Grant with State Person->Browser: Navigate to website Browser->Website: Website->Browser:Display login page Person->Browser: Enter Username / PW Browser->Website: (creds) Website->IDP: /token?uid=_&pw=&browser_ip=_ IDP->Website: {\"redirect\": \"/authz/state=1F2D41A\", ...} Website->Browser: Browser->IDP: /authz?state=1F2D41A IDP->IDP: check IP address is\\n same as state IDP->Browser: write cookie / send redirect_uri Browser->Website: redirect_uri Solution # In order to process the whole authorization, idea is to use resource owner password credentials grant type in the first stage, over there process the authentication as we do today, but also write in cache a short-lived token to recognize such authenticated user, then return to the client such short-lived token. During authorization, browser should send that token as part of the custom params and in the AS we should verify if that user is already authenticated using the short-lived param in the cache, then AS will write cookies, create the session and return to the client information required for this.

After that, user could need to authenticate, then decide whether permissions will be granted. Finally, the confirmation screen will be shown. Request user and device codes # This first step, device sends an HTTP POST request to Jans authorization server, at /jans-auth/restv1/device_authorization which is also presented in the Discovery url published by Jans Server, this endpoint could process a common authentication method or it could also not do any authentication, depending on the configuration for the client in Jans Server. Parameters # Parameter Description client_id Required The client ID for your application. scope Required A space separated list of scopes that identify the resources that the device could access on the user's behalf. These values inform the consent screen that Jans server displays to the user. Example # POST /restv1/device_authorization HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Host: test.jans.org Authorization: Basic MTIzLTEyMy0xMjM6WkE1aWxpTFFDYUR4 client_id=123-123-123&scope=openid+profile+address+email+phone Device Request response # In response, the Jans authorization server generates a unique device verification code and an end-user code that are valid for a limited time and includes them in the HTTP response body using the \"application/json\" format with a 200 (OK) status code. The response contains the following parameters: Parameter Description user_code Required The end-user verification code device_code Required The device verification code verification_uri Required The end-user verification URI on the authorization server. This should be shown to the end-user because he should open this url in the rich user-agent. verification_uri_complete Optional This is similar than verification_uri , however it also includes user_code as a query param in the url. It's issued if the device wants to use QR mode for example. expires_in Required The lifetime in seconds of the device_code and user_code . interval Required The minimum amount of time in seconds that the client should wait between polling requests to the token endpoint. Example: # HTTP/1.1 200 Content-Length: 307 Content-Type: application/json Server: Jetty(9.4.19.v20190610) { \"user_code\": \"SJFP-DTPL\", \"device_code\": \"aeb28bdc90d806ac58d4b0f832f06c3ac9c4bd03292f0c09\", \"interval\": 5, \"verification_uri_complete\": \"https://test.jans.io:8443/device-code?user_code=SJFP-DTPL\", \"verification_uri\": \"https://test.jans.io:8443/device-code\", \"expires_in\": 1800 } Device Display # Common flow, the device should display verification_url and user_code received from Jans server. The content that the device displays to the user should instruct the user to navigate to the verification_url on a separate device and enter the user_code . Design device interface following these rules: user_code has the following format: XXXX-XXXX where Xs represent to any ASCII character, for example: RTXD-HTLK . The length of the user_code will be always the same, therefore it's highly recommended to show it as clear and big that the user can read it easly. verification_url should be displayed also in a way that the user can read it easily. The normal length should be around 40 characters, however it could depends also on the domain used for the server. Remember that the user will need to write the whole URL manually in the web browser, therefore it's recommended to use a short URL. verification_url_complete will be used for those cases where device can show QR (Quick Response) codes or NFC (Near Field Communication) to save the user from typing the whole URI. Interaction between device and Jans server will be the same, however user can process the authorization faster. For example: User Login & Authorization # The user will need to put user_code value in the browser and after that, he will be redirected to the common authorization flow, it requires login whether there is no session between the user-agent and the Jans server and grant the permissions based on the device request. Poll Token # Since the user will be using a separate device to navigate to the verification_url and grant or deny access, the requesting device is not automatically notified when the user responds to the access request. For that reason, the requesting device needs to poll the Jans Server to determine when the user has responded to the request. The requesting device should continue sending polling requests until it receives a response indicating that the user has responded to the access request or until the device_code expires. The parameter interval returned in step 2 specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait between requests. The URL of the endpoint to poll is /jans-auth/restv1/token . The polling request contains the following parameters: Parameters # Parameter Description client_id Required The client ID for your application. grant_type Required Must be urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code . device_code Required The device verification code which is returned by Jans server in Step 2. Authentication can be done using any of those authentication methods for this token endpoint. Example: # POST /restv1/token HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Host: test.jans.io Authorization: Basic MTIzLTEyMy0xMjM6WkE1aWxpTFFDYUR4 grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Adevice_code&device_code=0bd7068e7fdab4bb91b313296a96462256a7370d12f073f0 Token Response # The Jans authorization server responds to each polling request with one of the following responses: Access granted If the user granted access to the device (by clicking Allow on the consent screen), then the response contains an access token and a refresh token. The tokens enable the device to access to the resource server on the user's behalf. In this case, the server responds with all tokens required and allowed to be issued depending on the configuration in the server.

Its endpoint can be used to manage configuration and other properties of Jans Auth Server . Jans Config API Plugins # Jans Config API follow a flexible plugin architecture in which the new features can be added using extensions called plugins without altering the application itself. In this section, we will discuss the steps to develop and add plugins in Jans Config API. The plugin architecture implemented in Jans Config API allows the deployer to add/remove new rest APIs (plugin) without changing the core application. A plugin contains one or more Rest API(s) packaged in a Java ARchive (jar file). It is added to Jans Config API by adding the plugin jar file path in the external extraClasspath of the jetty context file. Pre-requisites # The plugin developer should have an understanding of the following: Jakarta EE Platform : The plugin developer should know the Java programming language Weld : Weld is the reference implementation of CDI: Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE Platform JAX-RS : JAX-RS for creating RESTful web services.

We recommend Apache Directory Studio . Port forward the opendj pod. kubectl port-forward jans-opendj-0 -n <jans-namespace> 1636 :1636 --address 0 .0.0.0 1. Create a connection to the ldap browser. The default password will be Test1234# if not changed in the helm install command. Inside the browser navigate to o=jans, ou=scripts . Right click on ou=scripts and click on Quick Search . Inside the pop up box that appears fill Returning Attributes with displayName , and press Apply and Close In the results that appear click on the Dn that has a displayName of basic . Choose to load the script from file instead of ldap. Inside the browser change jansModuleProperty with value {\"value1\":\"location_type\",\"value2\":\"ldap\",\"description\":\"\"} to {\"value1\":\"location_type\",\"value2\":\"file\",\"description\":\"\"} Specify the Script Path location to the location of the folder inside auth server pods: /deploy/interception-scripts-ksync/basic.py .

Insert the following for the value: {\"value1\":\"location_path\",\"value2\":\"/deploy/interception-scripts-ksync/basic.py\",\"description\":\"\"} Enable the script by settings jansEnabled to true . The following is an example of how the basic script entry should look. Check the following log inside the the auth-server container to verify that auth server loaded the script properly: /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/logs/jans-auth_script.log . It should look like this: kubectl exec -ti <auth-server-pod-name> -n <jans-namespace> -- tail -f /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/logs/jans-auth_script.log You should find the following in the log: ...

Initialized successfully Download the jython jar for the interpreter. wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/python/jython-standalone/2.7.2/jython-standalone-2.7.2.jar From the IDE (Liclipse) menu: navigate to File -> Open File and choose the interception script that will be debugged in $(pwd)/interception-scripts-ksync/basic.py When opening the Python file for the first time, we need to instruct Liclipse to use a specific interpreter. Follow these steps: Press the \"Manual Config\" button in the dialog box after opening the Python file Open \"PyDev->Interpreters->Jython Interpreters\" Click the \"New...\" button in the right panel. Name it \"Jython\" and specify the interpreter executable that was downloaded previously \"jython-standalone-2.7.2.jar\" Click \"OK\", then confirm the settings by clicking \"OK\" again, then \"Apply and Close\" In the final dialog, confirm the settings by clicking \"OK\" Open basic.py in a file editor. After the import section, add the following lines to load the PyDev libraries: REMOTE_DEBUG = True if REMOTE_DEBUG: try: import sys import pydevd except ImportError as ex: print \"Failed to import pydevd: %s\" % ex raise Add this break condition to the first line in the authenticate method. Place the ip of the maching running the ide , here liclipse i.e 192.168.140.2 . if REMOTE_DEBUG: pydevd.settrace ( '<ip-of-machine-running-ide>' , port = 5678 , stdoutToServer = True, stderrToServer = True ) Save basic.py Within one minute, the auth server should load the changed file. Check the following log file again to make sure there are no load errors: /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/logs/jans-auth_script.log To check if the script works, update the default authentication method to Basic Authentication. Preform this in the LDAP browser. Navigate to o=jans,ou=configuration . Change the jansAuthMode to basic instead of simple_password_auth . After executing pydevd.settrace the script will transfer execution control to the PyDev server in Liclipse. You can use any debug commands. For example: Step Over (F6), Resume (F8), etc After debugging is finished, resume script execution to transfer execution control back to the auth server.","title":"Sample Scenario"},{"location":"admin/developer/interception-scripts/","text":"Interception Scripts (or custom scripts) # Interception scripts (or custom scripts) allow you to define custom business logic for various features offered by the OpenID Provider (Jans-auth server). Some examples of features which can be customized are - implementing a 2FA authentication method, consent gathering, client registration, adding business specific claims to ID token or Access token etc. Scripts can easily be upgraded and doesn't require forking the Jans Server code or re-building it. Types of Interception scripts in Jans server # Listed below, are custom scripts classified into various types, each of which represents a feature of the Jans server that can be extended as per the business need. Each script type is described by a java interface whose methods should be overridden to implement your business case. 1. Person Authentication : Allows the definition of multi-step authentication workflows, including adaptive authentication - where the number of steps varies depending on the context. 1. Consent Gathering : Allows exact customization of the authorization (or consent) process. By default, the OP will request authorization for each scope, and display the respective scope description. 1. User Registration 1. Update User 1. Client Registration 1.

Implementation in Pure Java # A script in Java refers to a java source file (e.g. Discovery.java ) which is compiled by AS and executed at runtime. Some rules: * The java class file containing the script should not have a package set. * The name of the class must match to the name set in CustomScriptType source code (e.g. for discovery script it is \"Discovery\") * Scripts must implement predefined interface which can be found against the CustomScriptType . For e.g. if you are writing a Person authentication script then your class should implement the following interface * All libraries available at runtime to server are available also to pure java script * To log to jans-auth_script.log use scriptLogger * Normal log will log in to jans-auth.log Example pure java script import io.jans.model.SimpleCustomProperty; import io.jans.model.custom.script.model.CustomScript; import io.jans.model.custom.script.type.discovery.DiscoveryType; import io.jans.service.custom.script.CustomScriptManager; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory; import org.json.JSONObject; import java.util.Map; /** * @author Yuriy Zabrovarnyy */ public class Discovery implements DiscoveryType { private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Discovery.class); private static final Logger scriptLogger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CustomScriptManager.class); @Override public boolean init(Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty> configurationAttributes) { log.info(\"Init of Discovery Java custom script\"); return true; } @Override public boolean init(CustomScript customScript, Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty> configurationAttributes) { log.info(\"Init of Discovery Java custom script\"); return true; } @Override public boolean destroy(Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty> configurationAttributes) { log.info(\"Destroy of Discovery Java custom script\"); return true; } @Override public int getApiVersion() { log.info(\"getApiVersion Discovery Java custom script: 11\"); return 11; } @Override public boolean modifyResponse(Object responseAsJsonObject, Object context) { scriptLogger.info(\"write to script logger\"); JSONObject response = (JSONObject) responseAsJsonObject; response.accumulate(\"key_from_java\", \"value_from_script_on_java\"); return true; } } Using Java libraries in a script: # Steps: 1. Add library jars to /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/libs/ 2. Edit /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/webapps/jans-auth.xml and add the following line replacing the word library-name with the actual name of the library: <Set name=\"extraClasspath\">/opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/libs/library-name.jar</Set> 3. Restart jans-auth service systemctl restart jans-auth Implementation in Jython # The example below is only meant to convey the concept, we will cover the details in later parts of the documentation. Suppose, we are implementing an Openbanking Identity platform and we have to add business specific claims say openbanking_intent_id to the ID token. The custom script which will help us accomplish our goal is of the type UpdateTokenType where the modifyIdToken method has to be implemented. A sample custom script with this business logic will be as stated below : class UpdateToken(UpdateTokenType): def __init__(self, currentTimeMillis): self.currentTimeMillis = currentTimeMillis def init(self, customScript, configurationAttributes): < initialization code comes here > return True def destroy(self, configurationAttributes): < clean up code comes here> return True def getApiVersion(self): return <version number> def modifyIdToken(self, jsonWebResponse, context): # Step1: <get openbanking_intent_id from session > sessionId = context.getSession() openbanking_intent_id = sessionId.getSessionAttributes().get(\"openbanking_intent_id \") # Step2: <add custom claims to ID token here> jsonWebResponse.getClaims().setClaim(\"openbanking_intent_id \", openbanking_intent_id ) Using Java libraries in a Jython script: # Steps: 1. Add library jars to /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/libs/ 2. Edit /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/webapps/jans-auth.xml and add the following line replacing the word library-name with the actual name of the library: <Set name=\"extraClasspath\">/opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/libs/library-name.jar</Set> 3. Restart jans-auth service systemctl restart jans-auth Using Python libraries in a script: # You can only use libraries (packages and modules) that are written in Pure Python . Importing a Python class which is a wrapper around a library written in C is not supported by the Jans server. As an example, the psycopg2 library used to connect to PostgreSQL from Python. Since it is a C wrapper around libpq, it won't work with Jython. Python 3 packages / modules are not supported. Steps: 1. Pure Python libraries should be added to /opt/jans/python/libs Using pip to install additional Python packages: Find out about your Jython version first. cd into the /opt directory in your Jans Server container and run ls. A directory named jython- should be listed too where will correspond to the Jython version. Note the version. Open the file /etc/jans/conf/jans.properties and look for the line starting with pythonModulesDir= . Append the value /opt/jython-<version>/Lib/site-packages to any existing value. Each value is separater by a colon (:). It should look something like this pythonModulesDir=/opt/jans/python/libs:/opt/jython-2.7.2a/Lib/site-packages Run the following command /opt/jython-<version>/bin/jython -m ensurepip Install your library with /opt/jython-<version>/bin/pip install <library_name> where is the name of the library to install. Restart the jans-auth service : systemctl restart jans-auth Debugging a Jython script # This article covers the details. Mandatory methods to be overridden # This is the base class of all custom script types and all custom scripts should implement the following methods. * init(self, customScript, configurationAttributes) : This method is only called once during the script initialization (or jans-auth service restarts). It can be used for global script initialization, initiate objects etc destroy(self, configurationAttributes) : This method is called when a custom script fails to initialize or upon jans-auth service restarts. It can be used to free resource and objects created in the init() method getApiVersion(self, configurationAttributes, customScript) : The getApiVersion method allows API changes in order to do transparent migration from an old script to a new API. Only include the customScript variable if the value for getApiVersion is greater than 10 Configurable properties of a custom script # Name unique identifier(name) for the custom script e.g. person_authentication_google Description Description text Programming Languages Python Level Used in Person Authentication script type, the strength of the credential is a numerical value assigned to the custom script that is tied to the authentication method. The higher the value, the stronger it is considered. Thus, if a user has several credentials enrolled, he will be asked to present the one of them having the highest strength associated. Location type Database - Stored in persistence (LDAP, MYSQL or PLSQL whichever applicable ) File - stored as a file Interactive Web - web application native - mobile application both Custom properties Key - value pairs for configurable parameters like Third Party API keys, location of configuration files etc Building business logic in a custom script # Jans-auth server uses Weld 3.0 (JSR-365 aka CDI 2.0) for managed beans. The most important aspects of business logic are implemented through a set of beans. This article presents many ready-to-use beans which can be used to build a script. Operations on custom scripts using jans-cli # Jans-cli supports the following six operations on custom scripts: get-config-scripts , gets a list of custom scripts. post-config-scripts , adds a new custom script. put-config-scripts , updates a custom script. get-config-scripts-by-type , requires an argument --url-suffix TYPE: ______ . You can specify the following types: PERSON_AUTHENTICATION, INTROSPECTION, RESOURCE_OWNER_PASSWORD_CREDENTIALS, APPLICATION_SESSION, CACHE_REFRESH, UPDATE_USER, USER_REGISTRATION, CLIENT_REGISTRATION, ID_GENERATOR, UMA_RPT_POLICY, UMA_RPT_CLAIMS, UMA_CLAIMS_GATHERING, CONSENT_GATHERING, DYNAMIC_SCOPE, SPONTANEOUS_SCOPE, END_SESSION, POST_AUTHN, SCIM, CIBA_END_USER_NOTIFICATION, PERSISTENCE_EXTENSION, IDP, or UPDATE_TOKEN. get-config-scripts-by-inum , requires an argument --url-suffix inum: _____ delete-config-scripts-by-inum , requires an argument --url-suffix inum: _____ The post-config-scripts and put-config-scripts require various details about the scripts.

Typically, person authentication flows are defined in the server by means of jython scripts that adhere to a predefined API. With Agama, flows are coded using a DSL (domain specific language) designed for the sole purpose of writing web flows. Important Here, a web flow is understood as a process composed by one or more stages, where at each stage an actor - normally a person - provides some kind of data or response by using a web browser or similar client. Throughout the process only a single actor is involved Some of the advantages of using Agama include: Ability to express authentication flows in a clean and concise way Flow composition is supported out-of-the-box: reuse of an existing flow in another requires no effort Reasoning about flows behavior is straightforward (as consequence of points 1 and 2). This makes flow modifications easy Small cognitive load. Agama DSL is a very small language with simple, non-distracting syntax Friendly UI templating engine. No complexities when authoring web pages - stay focused on writing HTML markup Scope and intended audience # Agama brings a lot of power to the table. In general, developers will be able to write arbitrary flows, ranging from very simple to multi-step non-linear dynamic flows. The effort required varies widely and depends on the underlying complexity and developer ability.

Jython flows vs. Agama # With respect to jython-based flows, Agama differs radically in two aspects: A DSL is used to structure flows where business logic and computations are delegated to Java Flow execution proceeds in a traditional, sequential manner. With jython scripts, an inversion of control (IoC) mechanism is employed where control jumps from one method to another in a script Despite the above, if you have coded jython authentication scripts in the past, this may represent an advantage since you will probably have acquaintance with some of the auth-server Java APIs. Agama engine # The Agama engine (a.k.a the \" engine \") is the piece of software in charge of reading flows written in Agama DSL and put them into action.

It only offers a safe way for short-lived web journeys to materialize. Hence, another piece is required to put flows in the context of a standard authorization framework like OpenId Connect.

Code comments # There is support for single line comments only (no block comments). Use // to start a comment. Comments can start anywhere in a line. Data types # In practice, values would fit into any of: string , boolean , number , list or map . Since Java methods can be invoked (more on this later), returned values might not match up exactly with these categories, however this is not too relevant because there is no strict type enforcement in Agama. Literals # Strings # They are surrounded by double quotes. Examples: \"Agama\" , \"blah\" , \"\" (empty string) Backslash can be used to escape chars, like \"Hello\\nGluu\" (line feed), \"Hi\\u0040\" (unicode character) Including double quotes in strings requires unicode escaping, like \"\\u0022\" . Using \"\\\"\" won't work Booleans # Only true or false allowed (notice they are lowercased) Numbers # They are expressed in base 10 only Can be signed or unsigned, with or without decimal: 0 , -1 , 2.0 , 2.3 , -3.000001 , etc. No exponential notation allowed (e.g. 1E-05 ) The following are not valid: .1 , -.1 , +1 . These are their OK equivalents: 0.1 , -0.1 , 1 Null # The \u201cspecial\u201d value null can be used (responsibly) to represent the absence of a value. It is a direct consequence of supporting Java in the DSL. Lists # They are finite sequences. Elements are separated by commas Examples: [ 1, 2, 3 ] , [ \"bah!\", \"humbug\" ] , [ ] (empty list) Elements of a list do not have to be of the same type: [ false, [ 0, 1], \"?\" ] is legal but generally discouraged Commas can be surrounded by any combination of spaces and new lines. This is handy when a list takes up some space. This is legal: [ \"no\", \"such\", \"thing\" , \"as\", \"a\", \"stupid\",\"question\"] Maps # They are in essence associative arrays (a.k.a. dictionaries): unordered collections of key/value pairs Example: { brand: \"Ford\", color: null, model: 1963, overhaulsIn: [ 1979, 1999 ] } . This map keys are brand , color , model , and overhaulsIn In literal notation, keys names must follow the pattern [a-zA-Z]( _ | [a-zA-Z] | [0-9] )* so these are all valid key names: a , Agama , b_a , a0_0 ; on the contrary, _a , 9 , -a , and \"aha\" are invalid key names As with lists, commas can be surrounded by any combination of spaces and new lines Variables # Variable names follow the pattern: [a-zA-Z]( _ | [a-zA-Z] | [0-9] )* camelCase naming is recommended Variables are not declared, just used freely. Variables are always global in a given flow They can be assigned a value using the equal sign. Example: colors = [ \"red\", \"blue\" ] They can be assigned several times in the same flow Accessing and mutating data in variables # Strings # Suppose x is a string. Individual characters can be accessed by zero-based indexes: x[0] , x[1] , etc. and they are themselves considered strings of size 1 x.length returns the string size (number of characters in it). Strings are not modifiable (neither size nor individual characters can be altered) Lists # Suppose x is a list. Elements can be accessed by zero-based indexes: x[0] , x[1] , etc. Elements of a list can be assigned (and re-assigned) using indexes too. Example: x[2] = false x.length returns the list size. This value can be updated in order to shrink or grow a list (e.g. x.length = 10 ). When extending a list beyond its current length, the \u201cgap\u201d created is filled with null values An attempt to access an index position greater than or equal to the list size returns null (most general-purpose languages would raise a runtime error in this situation) Using expressions for indexing is not allowed, like x[person.age] , x[y[0]] Click here to learn more about access in lists Maps # Suppose x is map. Values can be accessed by using \u201cdot notation\u201d Say x = { brand: \"Ford\", color: null, model: 1963, overhaulsIn: [ 1979, 1999 ] } , then x.model evaluates to 1963 , and x.overhaulsIn[1] evaluates to 1999 Setting the color would be like x.color = \"white\" A new key/value pair can be appended too: x.maxSpeed = 90 Access of an unknown property evaluates to null : x.owner If a key name does not follow the pattern [a-zA-Z]( _ | [a-zA-Z] | [0-9] )* an alternative notation must be employed to retrieve or modify the associated value.

As an example if age and name are available fields, x.age can be used to get the value of age Likewise, setting a value is possible too: x.name = \"Larry\" (if a suitable setter exists) In general, a no-args method starting with get or is can be invoked. This is useful for instance to get the (Java) class name of your object ( x.class.name ) or determine if a list has no elements ( x.empty ) In real flows developers would like to prefix a variable name with j when its value originates in a java call and does not match any of Agama types. Example: jCustomerDetail . Flow structure # A flow written in Agama consists of a header and one or more statements following. Header basics # A header is declarative by nature. It starts with the Flow keyword followed by the qualified name of the flow, e.g. Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey . A qualified name is a sequence of one or more fragments separated by dot ( . ) where a fragment follows the pattern [a-zA-Z]( _ | [a-zA-Z] | [0-9] )* . By convention, qualified names shall adhere to a reverse Internet domain name notation. In a header, at minimum, a base path literal string must be provided (in an indented block). This sets the relative directory where flow assets will reside: Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Next, flow timeout may be specified. This is the maximum amount of time available the end-user can take to fully complete a flow. For instance: Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Timeout 100 seconds An unsigned integer literal value must be specified after the Timeout keyword, if present. The timeout topic is regarded in Flows lifecycle . The Configs keyword may be used to designate a variable so the flow's properties can be accessed in the code. These properties are part of the flow metadata and are usually provided when the flow is created - whether manually or through an administrative tool. Often, these are used to supply configuration parameters to the flow. As an example, suppose a flow that sends a confirmation e-mail has to be implemented. Properties are a good place to hold the configuration of the outgoing mail server to employ: name, port, authentication credentials, etc. For instance, this is how the configuration properties would be bound to variable conf : Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Timeout 100 seconds Configs conf Inputs # In addition to the above, and optionally too, flows may receive inputs from their callers. Input names can be listed using the Inputs keyword: Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Inputs salutation askGender promptRealName Input names follow the same naming conventions (patterns) of variables and can be treated as such in code. Important Note the difference between properties and inputs. Properties are parameters that callers of the flow should not control or be interested in. On the other hand, inputs are parameters that callers supply explicitly to make the flow exhibit certain behaviors. To learn how callers can pass values to input parameters of a flow check: Subflows , or Authentication request (when the flow is launched directly from a web browser) Flow statements # The statements that make up a flow - body - come after the header and start at column 1, ie. aligned with the Flow keyword: Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Timeout 100 seconds Configs conf Inputs salutation askGender promptRealName x = \"Hi\" y = false ... There are several types of statements: branching, looping, web interaction, etc. They will be regarded in the subsequent sections of this document. Note Agama does not support the concept of subroutines/procedures; this is not needed because functional decomposition is carried out by calling subflows . Logging # To append data to the flows log, use the Log instruction. Examples: Code Message appended Notes Log \"Hi there\" Hi there Log \"Hello\" \"world\" Hello world Log can be passed a variable number of parameters Log \"Hello\" \"world\" 0 false Hello world 0 false Log [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 1, 2, 3, ...more Lists and maps are not traversed wholly Log \"Hell%% 0 %\" \"o\" \" world\" false Hello world 0 false Placeholders usage Log \"% % % yes\" 1 \"two\" 1 two % yes Log \"3\" \"%\" 0 3 % 0 Log \"@warn Today is Friday %th\" 13 Today is Friday 13th Message logged as warning Log \"@w Today's Armageddon \\u263A\" Today's Armageddon \u263a Message logged as warning By default messages are logged at the INFO level. Valid log levels are: Name shortcut error e warn w info i debug d trace t Conditionals and branching # Keywords When and Otherwise allow to write conditionals. With and , or , is , and is not , logical (boolean) expressions can be built. Examples: car = { brand: \"Ford\", color: null, model: 1963 } When car.color is null car.color = \"pink\" ... Nested conditionals: ... When car.color is \"pink\" When car.brand is \"Ford\" Log \"Weird-looking car\" ... Use of Otherwise : ... When car.color is not null Log \"you have a regular painted car\" ... Otherwise ... Boolean expressions can span several lines: and and or can be at the start or end of a line as long as the whole expression is left-aligned with its corresponding When . Examples: //legal: When day is cloudy When there is hope and there is mercy Log \"let's rock n' roll\" ... When day is cloudy When there is hope and // :D there is mercy or fear is null Log \"let's rock n' roll\" ... //illegal: When day is cloudy When there is hope and // :D there is mercy or fear is null Log \"let's rock n' roll\" ... When day is cloudy When there is hope and // :D there is mercy or fear is null Log \"let's rock n' roll\" ... Notes: Equality is designed to work with null , numbers, strings, and boolean values only. More exactly, a number should only be compared to a number, a string to a string, etc., otherwise the equality test evaluates to false . Comparing a value with itself evaluates to true regardless of type, i.e. car is car , null is null , false is false are all truthy. Comparisons are limited to equality ( is ) or inequality ( is not ). For other forms of comparison you can resort to Java. As expected and has higher priority than or when evaluating expressions. There is no way to group expressions to override the precedence: there are no parenthesis in Agama. Assigning the result of a boolean expression to a variable is not supported. These restrictions are important when writing conditionals. Advanced matching # Agama's Match ... to is a construct similar to C/Java switch . Example: car = ... x = ... y = ... // Assume x and y hold numbers z = [ 3.1416, 2.71828 ] Match car.model to x //Code in this block will be executed if car.model is equal to the value of x ... -y //Here we use minus y ... z[0] ... 1.618 //Literal values can be used too for matching ... null ... Otherwise //optional block //Instructions here are executed if there was no match at all Flow finish # Finish is used to terminate a flow's execution. A flow can finish successfully, failed, or aborted. Examples: Code Meaning Finish true Shorthand for flow finished successfully Finish false Shorthand for failed flow it = { success: true, data: { userId: \"as9233Qz\", ... }} Finish it Flow finished successfully. Some relevant data attached it = { success: false, error: \"User entered a wrong password 3 times\" } Finish it Flow failed. Error description attached Finish \"as9233Qz\" Shorthand for { success: true, data: { userId: \"as9233Qz\" } } it = { nonsense: [ null ] } Finish it.nonsense This causes the flow to crash. Note this is not equivalent to Finish false (which means the flow ended with a negative outcome). Notes: Any statements found after Finish is not reached and thus, not executed If no Finish statement is found in a flow's execution, this will degenerate in flow crash When a flow is finished and was used as subflow (part of the execution of a bigger parent flow), the parent does not terminate. Execution continues at the following instruction that triggered the subflow. More on Trigger later A flow cannot be aborted by itself. This can only be achieved through a parent flow. Learn more about aborted flows here Check the best practices on finishing flows here Web interaction # Web interaction constructs bring the most value to Agama. Developers can express the concepts of \u201dredirect a user to an external site and retrieve any data later provided\u201d or \u201cshow a page and grab user data after interaction\u201d using atomic instructions. RFAC # RFAC (stands for Redirect and Fetch at callback ) abstracts the process of redirecting the user's browser to an external site and then collect the data presented later at a designated callback URL. This feature is useful in inbound identity scenarios (e.g. to support social login). Example Details RFAC \"https://login.twitter.com/?blah..&boo=...\" Redirects to the given location. Once the user browser is taken to the callback URL by the external site (twitter.com), the flow continues ignoring any data included map = { twitter: { loginUrl: \"https://...\", ... }, ... } result = RFAC map.twitter.loginUrl Redirects to the given location. Once the user browser is taken to the callback URL by the external site, the data included in the query string or payload is stored in result (a _map_) for further processing Agama engine's callback URL is https://<your-server>/jans-auth/fl/callback . This resource is only available for a given browser session while RFAC is in execution. Once the callback is visited or the flow times out (whichever occurs first), subsequent requests will respond with an HTTP 404 error. RRF # RRF (stands for Render-Reply-Fetch ) abstracts the process of rendering a UI template, send the produced markup to the browser and grab user-provided data back at the server side. Example Details RRF \"survey.ftl\" Renders the template survey.ftl (located in this flow's base path) and resulting markup is replied to user's browser. Data submitted by the user is ignored obj = { salutation: \"Hey!\", ... } result = RRF \"survey.ftl\" obj Renders the template survey.ftl by injecting the data passed in obj and the resulting markup is replied to user's browser. Data submitted by the user is stored in variable result : a map whose keys are named according to the form fields present in survey.ftl Notes: The template location must be specified with a string literal only (not a variable). Normally the template must submit a POST to the current URL with the desired data. In HTML terms, it would look like <form method=\"post\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\">... for instance. Use map variables - not literals - for the second argument of RRF . Objects obtained from Java can be used except collections, arrays, strings, numbers, or boolean values. RRF can be passed a third parameter, that is, RRF templatePath variable boolean . When the boolean value is false , it exhibits the regular two-param behavior. Otherwise (truthy value) the callback URL (see RFAC ) will be available while RRF is in execution. In this case, if the callback is visited, data passed to it will be set as the result of the RRF call unless a POST to the current URL is received first, where behavior will be as usual. Finally, the callback resource is disabled. The three-param variant can be used when: The decision to redirect to an external site can only be done from the browser itself The external site expects to receive an HTTP POST Looping # There are two constructs available for looping in Agama: Repeat and Iterate over . Repeat # Repeat was designed with the concept of attempts/retries in mind: a set of statements are executed, a condition can optionally be supplied in order to abort the loop early, and (optionally too) a block of statements can be executed before the next iteration is started if the condition evaluated to false . A loop is given a maximum number of iterations. Examples: Example Notes month = \"\u2026\" Repeat 3 times max data = RRF \"guess_birthday_month.ftl\" //Quit is optional in loops Quit When data.guess is month A loop that runs 3 iterations at most. A page is shown at every iteration. If the value entered by the user matches that of `month` variable, the loop is aborted earlier x = \u2026 // an integer value month = \"\u2026\" obj = { error: null } Repeat x times max data = RRF \"guess_birthday_month.ftl\" obj Quit When data.guess is month obj.error = \"Wrong! try again\" Similar to previous example This time the max no. of iterations is set using a variable When there is a miss a message error is set (which the UI template may potentially use) x = \u2026 // an integer value month = \"\u2026\" obj = { error: null } y = Repeat x times max data = RRF \"guess_birthday_month.ftl\" obj Quit When data.guess is month obj.error = \"Wrong! try again\" Log \"Attempt number:\" idx[0] Similar to previous example After the loop finishes, variable y will contain the total number of iterations made to completion. This excludes partial iterations aborted by Quit , thus, y < = x Note the usage of implicit variable idx which holds the current (zero-based) iteration number Iterate over # Iterate over is used to traverse the items of a string, list, or the keys of a map. At every iteration, a variable is set with the current item or key name. As with Repeat , a loop may be aborted earlier, an optional block of statements can be specified after Quit , and the total number of iterations can be stored in a variable. Example Notes seasons = [ \"spring\", \"winter\", \"fall\", \"summer\" ] Iterate over seasons using sn Log \"There is nothing like\" sn A loop running over a simple list. Every element visited is referenced with variable sn human = { weight: 100, height: 5.9, age: 26 } Iterate over human using attribute Log attribute \"is\" human.$attribute Iterates over the keys of the map printing both the key and its associated value. To learn about the .$ notation see [Maps and dot notation](#maps-and-dot-notation) seasons = [ \"spring\", \"winter\", \"fall\", \"summer\" ] sports = [ \"soccer\", \"golf\", \"tennis\" ] Iterate over seasons using sn Iterate over sports using sport Log \"There is nothing like playing % in %\" sport sn Nested loops seasons = [ \"spring\", \"winter\", \"fall\", \"summer\" ] sports = [ \"soccer,\" \"golf\", \"tenis\" ] Iterate over seasons using sn y = Iterate over sports using sport Log \"Shall we play % in % ?\" sport sn Quit When sn is \"winter\" Log \"yes!\" Log \"We played % sports in %\" y sn Similar to the previous example. The inner loop is aborted upon a given condition. Note the total number of complete iterations is recorded in y every time the inner loop finishes. seasons = [ \"spring\", \"winter\", \"fall\", \"summer\" ] sports = [ \"soccer,\" \"golf\", \"tenis\" ] Iterate over seasons using sn Iterate over sports using sport Log idx[0] idx[1] Prints iteration numbers: 0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 1 0, 1 1, 1 2, ... 3 2 The index used in idx is 0 for the outermost loop and increases by one at every level of loop nesting Subflows # A flow can Trigger another flow (a.k.a subflow) and grab its response when Finish ed. This feature materializes flow composition and re-use in Agama. Example Notes Trigger jo.jo.PersonalInfoGathering Starts the flow with qualified name jo.jo.PersonalInfoGathering . Returned data is ignored outcome = Trigger jo.jo.PersonalInfoGathering null false Log \"subflow returned with success?\" outcome.success Starts a flow passing parameters (assuming PersonalInfoGathering receives two inputs). outcome will contain the map used when the subflow ended userPrefs = { otp: \"...\", ... } Match userPrefs.otp to \"e-mail\" flow = \"co.acme.EmailOTP\" \"sms\" flow = \"co.acme.SmsOTP\" Trigger $flow Starts a flow whose qualified name is determined at runtime Input parameters # The values passed after the Trigger keyword are supplied as input parameters in the order declared by the subflow's Inputs . When not enough values are passed, the unassigned inputs will hold a null value. Note list and map literals cannot be passed as arguments to Trigger : Illegal: Trigger subflow { key: [ 1, 2 , 3] } [ \"Yeeha!\" ] Legal: Trigger subflow x car.model list[1] null false -3 \"Sam\" Template overrides # When re-using flows, existing templates may not match the required look-and-feel or layout of the flow that is being built, or may require minor adjustments to fit better the parent's needs. These can be overcome by declaring which templates the developer would like to override for a given subflow call. Example: outcome = Trigger jo.jo.PersonalInfoGathering Override templates \"path/basic.ftl\" \"\" \"path2/dir/detail.ftl\" \"tmp/mydetail.ftl\" Log \"subflow returned with success?\" outcome.success In an indented block using the Override templates keyword, several string literals can be provided. They specify the paths of the (subflows) templates that will be overriden by the parent and the corresponding new paths. In the example above, templates path/basic.ftl and path2/dir/detail.ftl rendered by flow PersonalInfoGathering (or its subflows) won't be picked from these locations but from the base path of the current (parent) flow using names basic.ftl and tmp/mydetail.ftl respectively. Usage of empty string denotes reusing the same file name than the original file. Alternatively, every pair of original vs. overriden path can be specified in a single line for more clarity, like this: outcome = Trigger jo.jo.PersonalInfoGathering Override templates \"path/basic.ftl\" \"\" \"path2/dir/detail.ftl\" \"tmp/mydetail.ftl\" ... To learn more about how paths in template overrides work, see writing UI pages . About recursive invocations # A flow cannot trigger itself. Also, mutual calls (e.g. A triggering B , and B triggering A ) must be avoided at all cost. Java interaction # Note Java language background is required for this section. In Agama, Java or Groovy code can be called by means of the Call instruction. Specifically, public methods from public classes or static methods from public interfaces. Example Notes Call java.lang.Integer#parseInt \"FF\" 16 Invokes the parseInt method of Integer class passing the given arguments (i.e. conversion of hexadecimal string to a primitive int ). The returned value is ignored numbers = [ 2, -2, 0, 3, -3, 4 ] small = Call java.util.Collections#min numbers Invokes the min method of the Collections class. Supplies a list of numbers as argument. The smallest number is stored in variable small jLocale = Call java.util.Locale#getDefault localeName = jLocale.displayName Computes the display name of the JVM default locale car = { brand: \"Ford\", model: 1963 } sidecar = Call java.util.Map#copyOf car Makes a deep clone of a map number | E = Call java.lang.Integer#parseInt \"AGA\" 16 When E is not null Log \"An error occurred:\" E.message Similar to the first example. If an exception is thrown by the invocation, it's caught and assigned to variable E , while number is assigned null . Note both checked and unchecked exceptions are caught | E = Call com.acme.NotifyExternalSystem //Do something with E //... If exception catching is required when calling a method that returns void , there is no need to put a variable before the pipe p1 = Call java.awt.Point#new p2 = Call java.awt.Point#new 1 3 Call p2 translate -1 1 Creates instances of class java.awt.Point with different constructors. For p1 the no-args constructor is used. Method translate is invoked on the p2 instance. Note usage of a space here instead of hash ( # ) cls1 = Call java.lang.CharSequence#class cls2 = Call java.lang.Integer#class Call cls2 parseInt \"FF\" 16 Stores in cls1 a reference to interface class CharSequence.class . Stores in cls2 a reference to Integer.class . The 3rd line statement achieves the same effect of Call java.lang.Integer#parseInt \"FF\" 16 L = [ \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" ] S = Call java.util.Set#of 0 2 4 6 map = { numbers: S, letters: L } hasOne = Call map.numbers contains 1 Calls the contains method of the java.util.Set object stored in map.numbers passing 1 as argument and storing the result in hasOne The usage of a hash sign (or spaces) before a method name helps disambiguate whether the invocation is on a static class method or an object method. This is so because an expression like hey.You may reference the class You on package hey , or the value of key You in a map named hey . Highlights # Any method that meets the conditions above (public or interface static) and that is reachable in the JVM classpath can be called; developers are not restricted solely to java.* packages. When using Call , the method to execute is picked based on the name (e.g. after the # sign) and the number of arguments supplied. If a class/interface exhibits several methods with the same name and arity (number of parameters), there is no way to know which of the available variants will be called. The java.util.Arrays class has several methods of this kind for instance. Once a concrete method is picked, a best effort is made to convert (if required) the values passed as arguments so that they match the expected parameter types in the method signature. If a conversion fails, this will degenerate in an IllegalArgumentException . list and map literals cannot be passed as arguments to method calls directly. This means the following is illegal: Call co.Utils#myMethod { key: [ 1, 2 , 3] } [ \"Yeeha!\" ] . To achieve the same effect assign the literal value to a variable and pass that instead. Exception handling # As seen in the examples Agama can deal with Java exceptions, however, this feature should be used sparingly. When exception handling is really required, create wrapper methods in Java to do it instead of delegating that to the DSL. OOP prose warning # Java support adds the ability to execute pieces of business logic required to build up a flow. These \u201cpieces of logic\u201d match well to Java methods, however situations like this must be avoided: x = \u2026 // A java object obtained in some way y = \u2026 // A java object obtained in some way Call x methodA arg1 arg2 \u2026 Call x methodB arg1 arg2 arg3 \u2026 z = Call y methodC \u2026 Call x methodD \u2026 z \u2026 If all those calls represent a meaningful unit of work they should be abstracted out and grouped into a single method invocation which should be thoroughly implemented in Java. Note Agama should not be used to do object-oriented programming but to make a clear, concise representation of a flow. As a rule of thumb, let Java do the heavy work; this is wiser, safer, and faster. Advanced and special cases in variable manipulation # Indexing in lists # Accessing/modifying list elements requires providing a numeric index between the brackets, e.g. x[ 0 ] . Note variables can also be used for indexing, like x[ y ] where y is a positive integer or zero. For the below table, assume x = [ \"one\", \"two\", \"three\" ] . x[1] //\"two\" y = 1 x[y] //\"two\" x[\"1\"] //illegal x[ z[0] ] //illegal: variable expressions not allowed for indexes x[obj.property] //illegal: variable expressions not allowed for indexes Maps and dot notation # The regular \u201cdot\u201d notation is limited in the sense it is fairly static: developers have to have prior knowledge about the keys' names, in other words, about the structure of maps and nested submaps, like in person.homeAddress.postalCode . Also, there might be cases where a key name does not fit the required pattern, like in person.street-address or persona.direcci\u00f3n ; even worse, there might be cases where the actual key is only known at runtime. There are ways to overcome this: Example Notes x.\"- wow!\" Access the value associated to the key named -wow! prop = ... x.$prop Access the value associated to the key whose name is contained in the variable prop (that holds a string value). Note actual value of prop may be originated from a Java call or another form of computation propA = ... propB = ... x.$propA.c.\"d\".$propB A mix of notations is valid. For example, if x= { a: { b: 0, c: { c: true, d: { e: null, f: \"hello\" } } } } , propA is equal to \"a\" , and propB to \"f\" , the expression on the left evaluates \"hello\" Usage of .$ requires to supply a variable after the dollar sign: grouped variable expressions are not supported. Thus, it is not possible to achieve something like x.a.c.($map.mykey).f in order to obtain \"hello\" if map = { mykey: \"d\" } . Indexing in maps # For convenience, when a key name \u201clooks like\u201d a positive integer (or zero), e.g. \"2\" , \"10\" , etc., numeric values can directly be used to get/set data in a map: x = { } x.\"1\" = \"golf\" x[1] //retrieves \"golf\" x[2] = \"polo\" //adds the key/value pair \"2\" / \"polo\" Language keywords # The following is a list of reserved words and as such, cannot be used as variable names or maps keys (in literal notation).

This is useful for instance to get the (Java) class name of your object ( x.class.name ) or determine if a list has no elements ( x.empty ) In real flows developers would like to prefix a variable name with j when its value originates in a java call and does not match any of Agama types.

This sets the relative directory where flow assets will reside: Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Next, flow timeout may be specified. This is the maximum amount of time available the end-user can take to fully complete a flow. For instance: Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Timeout 100 seconds An unsigned integer literal value must be specified after the Timeout keyword, if present. The timeout topic is regarded in Flows lifecycle . The Configs keyword may be used to designate a variable so the flow's properties can be accessed in the code. These properties are part of the flow metadata and are usually provided when the flow is created - whether manually or through an administrative tool. Often, these are used to supply configuration parameters to the flow. As an example, suppose a flow that sends a confirmation e-mail has to be implemented.

The Full reference provides a more detailed insight on the different DSL elements. Introduction # Agama flows are written using a small DSL (domain specific language) designed purposedly for writing web flows. Some remarkable features of the DSL include: It helps depicting the structure of web flows in a natural way It is closer to human language than general-purpose programming languages It has a clean, concise, non-distracting syntax It has by design limited computational power forcing computations to occur in a more formal, general-purpose language like Java Intrinsic properties to highlight: It follows the imperative paradigm mainly, and makes use of a few declarative elements Execution takes place in a traditional sequential manner Flows can be treated as functions (reusable routines with well-defined inputs) It has no special constructs focused on authentication semantics: a flow simply finishes with a positive or negative result (plus optional extra data), however It provides dedicated contructs for common patterns in web flows like: \"show a page\" and \"retrieve the data user provided in that page\" \"redirect a user to an external site\" and later \"retrieve the data provided at the callback url\" It supports typical language elements like assignments, conditionals, loops, etc. Important In the process of flow writing, the DSL should be mainly used to structure a flow and collect user data while delegating more intensive tasks like querying databases, invoking web services, and so on, to Java. Language compiler # Agama is not a compiled language. Code is transpiled to an intermediate representation which is then interpreted at runtime. Developers don't need to issue special commands for transpilation to occur. This is automatically executed in the background by the engine some seconds after a flow has been added or modified. The process of checking and fixing potential syntax errors is described here . Syntactic features # Agama is case sensitive, e.g. X and x are two different things With a few exceptions, instructions always have to be written in a single line There are no parenthesis or semicolons Nesting of blocks takes place by using indented blocks Single line comments are supported. Use // to start a comment anywhere in a given line Data types, literals and variables # Agama is a dynamically typed language. Data types are not explicit in code and variables are not declared, just used. Type checks occur at runtime. Values fit into any of: string , boolean , number , list or map . Also, the \"special\" value null can be used to represent the absence of a value. The table below presents examples of literals: Type Valid literals Invalid literals string \"Agama\"; \"\"; \"Hello\\nGluu\" (line feed usage) \"\"\" boolean true; false True; yes; FALSE number 0.1; -0.1; 1; 1000; 255 .1; -.1; +1; 1e+03; 0xFF list []; [1, 2, 3]; [1, [2, 3]]; [\"Agama\", false] [1..3]; [1..] map {}; { Color: \"blue\" }, { a: { a_b: [\"foo\"] } } { _a: 2 }; { 2: 2 }; See the full reference to learn more about literals. A variable is global in the flow where it is being used. Examples of valid variable names are: x , mom , Yes , A_ha , B52 . The following are invalid: 4 , \"red\" , _oh , A-ha . Variables can be assigned a value several times in the same flow. Examples of valid assignments: x = 0 , mom = \"love\" , Yes = true , A_ha = [ 2.718, 3.141 ] , B52 = { rock: \"lobster\" } Depending on the data type of a variable, its underlying value(s) can be accessed or modified in a variety of ways. As shown in the table bellow Agama feels pretty natural: Sample assignment Access/Mutation example Result x = \"Hi\" x[0] \"H\" x = \"Hi\" x.length 2 x = \"Hi\" x[1] = \"o\" Strings are immutable x = [1, 2, 3] x[1] 2 x = [1, 2, 3] x[3] null x = [1, 2, 3] x[0] = \"zero\" [\"zero\", 2, 3] x = [1, 2, 3] x.length = 5 [\"zero\", 2, 3, null, null] x = { a: true } x.a true x = { a: true } x.b null x = { a: true } x.c = false { a: true, c: false } A variable whose value is the product of a Java call can be accessed and manipulated as described here . See the full reference to learn more about accessing and mutating data in variables. Flow structure # A flow consists of a header and one or more statements following. The header starts with the Flow keyword followed by the qualified name of the flow, e.g. Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey . Next, in an indented block several aspects can be provided (in this specific order): The base directory to use for this flow's assets Flow timeout A variable to hold flow configurations Variables to receive flow inputs Except for the base directory, all of these are optional. The following is an example of a flow header, where the folder mydir should hold the assets of the flow (more info on assets here ). The flow may receive three parameters: salutation , askGender , and promptRealName from their callers (when used as subflow ) or from the authentication request when the flow is launched directly from a web browser. Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Inputs salutation askGender promptRealName The statements that make up the flow (body) come after the header and start at column 1, ie. aligned with the Flow keyword: Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Inputs salutation askGender promptRealName x = \"Hi\" y = false ... See the full reference to learn more about flow structure. Logging # With the Log instruction data can be sent to the flows log. Check the logging page for more details. Some illustrative examples follow: Code Message appended Notes Log \"Hi there\" Hi there Log \"Hello\" \"world\" 0 false Hello world 0 false Log can be passed a variable number of parameters Log [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 1, 2, 3, ...more Lists and maps are not traversed wholly Log \"Hell%% 0 %\" \"o\" \" world\" false Hello world 0 false Placeholders usage Log \"@warn Today is Friday %th\" 13 Today is Friday 13th Message logged as warning By default messages are logged at the INFO level. This can be customized as in the last row. Conditionals and branching # When and Otherwise allow to write conditionals. With and , or , is and is not , logical (boolean) expressions can be built. Examples: car = { brand: \"Ford\", color: null, model: 1963 } When car.color is null car.color = \"pink\" ... Nested conditionals: ... When car.color is \"pink\" When car.brand is \"Ford\" Log \"Weird-looking car\" ... Use of Otherwise : ... When car.color is not null Log \"you have a regular painted car\" ... Otherwise ... Notes: Equality is designed to work with null , numbers, strings, and boolean values only. More exactly, a number should only be compared to a number, a string to a string, etc., otherwise the equality test evaluates to false. Comparisons are limited to equality ( is ) or inequality ( is not ). For other forms of comparison you can resort to Java. Agama also has Match ... to , a construct similar to C/Java switch . See the full reference to learn more about conditionals and branching. Flow finish # Finish is used to terminate a flow's execution. In general, a flow can finish successfully or failed. Examples: Code Meaning it = { success: true, data: { userId: \"as9233Qz\", ... }} Finish it Flow finished successfully. Some relevant data attached it = { success: false, error: \"User entered a wrong password 3 times\" } Finish it Flow failed. Error description attached Finish \"as9233Qz\" Shorthand for { success: true, data: { userId: \"as9233Qz\" } } See the full reference to learn more about flows termination. Web interaction # RFAC # The RFAC (Redirect and Fetch at callback) instruction abstracts the process of redirecting the user's browser to an external site and collect the data presented later at a designated callback URL. Important Agama engine's callback URL is https://<your-server>/jans-auth/fl/callback . Example: result = RFAC \"https://login.twitter.com/?blah..&boo=...\" This redirects to the given URL. Once the user browser is taken to the callback by the external site (e.g. twitter.com), the data included in the query string or payload is stored in result (a map ) for further processing. See the full reference to learn more. RRF # The RRF (Render-Reply-Fetch) instruction expresses the concept of \"show a page and grab user data after interaction\". It takes the path to a template and injects a value into it. The produced ( R endered) markup is sent ( R eplied) to the browser and finally, the result of the interaction of the user with the page can be retrieved ( F etched). Example Details RRF \"survey.ftl\" Renders the template survey.ftl (located in this flow's base path) and resulting markup is replied to user's browser. Data submitted by the user is ignored obj = { salutation: \"Hey!\", ... } result = RRF \"survey.ftl\" obj Renders the template survey.ftl by injecting the data passed in obj and the resulting markup is replied to user's browser. Data submitted by the user is stored in variable result : a map whose keys are named according to the form fields present in survey.ftl Notes: The template location must be specified with a string literal only (not variables) RRF has more capabilities. See the full reference to learn more. Looping # Repeat # Repeat was designed with the concept of attempts/retries in mind: a set of statements are executed, a condition can optionally be supplied in order to abort the loop early, and (optionally too) a block of statements can be executed before the next iteration is started if the condition evaluated to false . Example: x = ... // an integer value month = \"...\" obj = { error: null } y = Repeat x times max data = RRF \"guess_birthday_month.ftl\" obj Quit When data.guess is month obj.error = \"Wrong! try again\" This loop runs x iterations at most. At every iteration the template guess_birthday_month.ftl is RRF'ed. If the value provided at the browser matches that of month variable the loop is aborted earlier, otherwise an error message is set - and template may potentially use it. After the loop finishes, variable y will contain the total number of iterations made to completion. This excludes partial iterations aborted by Quit . Notes: - Quit and the statements following are optional - The variable assignment before the Repeat keyword is optional - See the full reference to learn more about Repeat Iterate over # Iterate over is used to traverse the items of a string, list, or the keys of a map. At every iteration, a variable is set with the current item or key name. As with Repeat , a loop may be aborted earlier, an optional block of statements can be specified after Quit , and the total number of iterations can be stored in a variable. Example: seasons = [ \"spring\", \"winter\", \"fall\", \"summer\" ] sports = [ \"soccer,\" \"golf\", \"tenis\" ] Iterate over seasons using sn y = Iterate over sports using sport Log \"Shall we play % in % ?\" sport sn Quit When sn is \"winter\" Log \"yes!\" Log \"We played % sports in %\" y sn The above features loop nesting. The outer loop iterates over seasons list and the inner one over sports . The variables sn and sport hold the current visited element. The inner loop is aborted upon a given condition. The total number of complete iterations is recorded in y every time the inner loop finishes. See the full reference to learn more about Iterate over . Subflows # A flow can Trigger another flow (a.k.a subflow) and grab its response when Finish ed. This feature materializes flow composition and re-use in Agama. Example: outcome = Trigger jo.jo.PersonalInfoGathering null false Log \"subflow returned with success?\" outcome.success The above starts the flow identified by jo.jo.PersonalInfoGathering passing the given parameters (assuming it receives two inputs). When done, outcome will reference the map that was employed to Finish the subflow, in other words, its response. See the full reference to learn more about Trigger . Java interaction # Agama interfaces seemlessly with Java or Groovy by means of the Call instruction. Recall the DSL is designed to force developers use Java when the task at hand cannot be implemented by simple data manipulation or comparison of values. This way a flow written in Agama DSL serves fundamentally as a depiction of the flow itself, hiding most of the internal details and low-level computations. See the full reference to learn more about Call .","title":"DSL Guide"},{"location":"admin/developer/agama/dsl/#agama-dsl","text":"Note This document presents a view of the most relevant aspects and constructs of the language.

Unable to find a method called ... with arity ... in class ... # A java invocation is attempting to call a method that is not part of the given class or the number of parameters passed for the method is not correct. No Finish instruction was reached # This occurs when no Finish statement has been found in the execution of a flow and there are no remaining instructions. Classes added on the fly # A class does not \"see\" other classes in its own package # This is a limitation of the scripting engine. Here, classes have to be imported even if they belong to the same package, or the fully qualified name used. How to append data to a flow's log directly? # Call method log of class io.jans.agama.engine.script.LogUtils . This method receives a variable number of arguments as DSL's Log does. Thus you can do LogUtils.log(\"@w Today is Friday %th\", 13) , as in the logging examples . What Groovy and Java versions are supported? # Groovy 4.0 and Java 11. The runtime is Amazon Corretto 11. Templates # How to implement localization? # Store all messages that your templates may show in the jans-auth resource bundle. This can be done by creating files named jans-auth_xx.properties or jans-auth_xx_YY.properties in /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/i18n . As an example, use jans-auth_ja.properties to hold the messages translated to Japanese, or jans-auth_de_CH.properties for German localized to Switzerland. The syntax of these files adhere to that of Java properties files. The suffixes xx and YY are driven by RFC 4647 and RFC 5646. Agama engine will pick the messages from the bundle that best matches the language settings of the end-user browser. Normally, this is supplied through the HTTP header Accept-Language . A file with no suffix, i.e. jans-auth.properties is used as fallback when a message cannot be found in specific language/country combination. To learn how to reference a message in a template, visit this page. How to modify the built-in error pages? # Agama features some error pages out-of-the-box. They can be customized by editing the corresponding files referenced in the configuration doc page. Is Javascript supported? # Yes, the template engine is not concerned about the kind of contents linked in markup. It does not even care if your markup makes any sense. For FreeMarker, templates just produce a textual output. A flow page is not rendered as HTML, the browser just shows the source code as text # This is due to lack of proper Content-Type response header. This occurs if your template has filename extension other than ftlh . If you don't want to rename your template, insert <#ftl output_format=\"HTML\"> at the beginning of the file. How to produce JSON instead of HTML? # In your templates use <#ftl output_format=\"JSON\"> in the first line. Take a look at the templates whose name start with json_ in folder /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama . Particularly check how JSON content can be escaped - unfortunately FreeMarker does not support escaping for JSON out-of-the-box. Development tools # Are there any IDE or editor plugins available for coding flows? # Not yet unfortunately. We plan to offer tools in the future to ease the development process. How to debug flows? # We plan to offer a debugger in the future. In the meantime, you can do printf -like debugging using the Log instruction. See Agama logging . About Agama engine # Does it support AJAX? # If you require a flow with no page refreshes, it could be implemented using AJAX calls as long as they align to the POST-REDIRECT-GET pattern, where a form is submitted, and as response a 302/303 HTTP redirection is obtained. Your Javascript code must also render UI elements in accordance with the data obtained by following the redirect (GET). Also, care must be taken in order to process server errors, timeouts, etc. In general, this requires a considerable amount of effort. If you require AJAX to consume a resource (service) residing in the same domain of your server, there is no restriction - the engine is not involved. Interaction with external domains may require to setup CORS configuration appropriately in the authentication server. I want/need to understand the internals, where to start? # The quick start guide is a must, followed by Hello world flow for project maintainers . In the end a complete sweep over all the docs is needed. Miscellaneous # Does flow execution timeout? # Yes.

From a programming perspective, a flow is a lot like a function or subroutine in a regular program. Once a flow is triggered, it is executed from top to bottom until a Finish statement is encountered. There are no asynchronous calls, threads, event listeners or callbacks to deal with. There are no requirements on flow initialization or flow structure either. The RRF construct makes code look totally fluid despite there is a \"pause\" once the response (markup) is sent. When this occurs there is no server-side processing taking place at all. Only after the user submits data to the server the flow is \"resumed\" and execution continues. With RFAC a similar pause happens except resumption is triggered by means of a browser redirect. The above makes the lifecycle of a flow very simple: after triggered, it advances and terminates when it is finished , aborted , or times out . Flow advance and navigation # Once a web page (or a response in general) is replied to a web client (browser), a POST is required to make the flow proceed, see RRF . The POST is expected to be sent to the current URL only, otherwise, a 404 error will be thrown. The engine will then respond with a redirect (usually 301) so the client will GET the next URL to be rendered. This pattern of navigation is known as \"POST-REDIRECT-GET\". There is a clear correspondence of the \"current URL\" with the physical path of the template rendered. As an example, if the browser location shows https://<your-host>/jans-auth/fl/foo/bar.fls , the involved template is stored at /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl/foo and has name bar . This makes flows more predictable and easier to reason about. Note however URLs are not manipulable: an attempt to set the browser location to a URL corresponding to a different template will not make that template be rendered or provoke any unexpected jump in the flow control. Instead, an error page is shown that allows users to re-take where they left off or to restart from scratch. In other words, navigation honors the \"current flow URL\" avoiding attempts to re-visit past stages or make unexpected moves to future ones. Additionally, the engine by default sends responses with proper HTTP headers so page contents are not cached. This is key to prevent manipulation and allows a safe usage of the browser's back button, where it will not be possible to visit past stages. Finishing flows # Carefully decide how use the Finish directive in a flow. Specially when terminating sucessfully, many times developers would like to attach the identity of the user in question, as in Finish userId . This results in a successful authentication event and makes sense, but this is not always desired. Sometimes due to decomposition practices (in order to favor re-use and better organization), small flows can arise that should not carry the user identifier. As an example, suppose several flows exist for OTP (one-time passcode) authentication, like SMS, e-mail, token-based, etc. These would receive the user identifier as an input and act accordingly by verifying the passcode the user has entered at the browser. A parent flow can be used to prompt for a username and password first, and then forward the user to the OTP flow that better matches the user's preferences. This sounds fine, however, since any enabled flow can be triggered by means of an authentication request, a skilled individual might try to launch one of the OTP flows directly passing proper parameters. This would result in authentications using a single factor (i.e. no password) which is undesirable. Thus, it is recommended to include userId in Finish only when there is a reason to do so, that is, when the authentication carried out by the flow is strong enough. This largely depends on the defined organization policies, but using a two-factor authentication is often a good sign of strength. Another approach is disabling flows that should not be triggered from a browser directly. Disabled flows can still be used as subflows from other flows. Recall the simplest way to express a positive authentication outcome is just Finish true . Cancellation # This is a feature that in conjuction with template overrides allows developers to implement backtracking or alternative routing. Suppose a flow is designed to reuse two or more existing subflows. As expected these subflows are neither aware of each other nor of its parent. How can the parent make so that once the user has landed at a page belonging to a given subflow A be presented the alternative to take another route, say, to subflow B? Clearly a page at flow A can be overriden, however, how to abort A and make it jump to B? The answer is cancellation. Through flow cancellation, a running flow can be aborted and the control returned to one of its parents for further processing. This can achieved by overriding a template so that the POST to the current URL includes a form field named _abort . POSTing this way will provoke the associated Trigger call to return a value like { aborted: true, data: ... } where data is a map consisting of the payload (form fields) sent with the POST. Thus, developers can build custom pages and add for example a button to provoke the cancellation. Then, back in the flow implementation take the user to the desired path. As an example, suppose there exists two flows that allow users to enter and validate a one-time passcode (OTP), one flow sends the OTP via e-mail while the other through an SMS. Assume these flows receive a user identifier as input and render a single UI page each to enter the received OTP. If we are interested in building a flow that prompts for username/password credentials and use the SMS-based OTP flow with a customization that consists of showing a link like \"Didn't get an SMS?, send the passcode to my e-mail\", the following is a sketch of an implementation: ... //validate username/password ... result = Trigger co.acme.SmsOTP userId Override templates \"path/to/enter_otp.ftlh\" \"cust_enter_otp.ftlh\" When result.aborted is true //The user clicked on \"send the passcode to my e-mail\" result = Trigger co.acme.EmailOTP userId When result.success is true result.data = { userId: userId } Finish result The overriden template cust_enter_otp.ftlh would have a form like: ... <form method=\"post\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"> <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-link\" id=\"_abort\" name=\"_abort\" value=\"\"> Didn't get an SMS?, send the passcode to my e-mail</button> </form> (if webCtx is not familiar to you, check Contextual objects ). Ideas for a good experience: SmsOTP and EmailOTP should account for retries in their implementation, e.g. give the user 2-3 opportunities to enter an OTP. This can be parameterized, for instance. These flows should not contain data: { userId: ... } when they finish successfully. If any of them are used standalone - not as subflows - the result will be a successful authentication for the given user. This means someone can have access to the protected resource (e.g. target application) with just entering a valid OTP and knowledge a valid user identifier. This is often weak in terms of security. An extra authentication factor should be required, like a password as in the example above Cancellation bubble-up # In order to override a page, the path to the corresponding template can be easily derived from the URL seen at the browser's address bar when the subflow is Trigger ed. Note the page may not necessarily belong directly to the subflow triggered but probably to another flow lying deep in a chain of Trigger invocations. As an example suppose you are interested in building a flow A that reuses flow B. You identify a page shown that needs to be overriden. It might happen this page is actually rendered by C - a flow that B in turn reuses. In scenarios like this cancellation still works transparently and developers need not be aware of flows dependencies. In practice, when cancellation occurs at A, it bubbles up to B and then to C, which is the target of this process. Note that even flow B (as is) may also be overriding A's templates. Resolution of a template path takes place from the inner to the outer flow, so it occurs this way in the example: path is as found in A's RRF instruction path is looked up on the list provided in B's Override templates . If a match is found, path is updated accordingly path is looked up on the list provided in C's Override templates . If a match is found, path is updated accordingly The page referenced by path is rendered When a page POSTs a cancellation as described earlier, the flow to return control to is determined by the path of the template that issued the given POST. Similarly a lookup on B's Override templates takes place followed by other on A's. Timeouts # Authentication flows are normally short-lived. They usually span no more than a few minutes. In Agama, the maximum amount of time an end-user can take to fully complete a flow is driven by the configuration of the authentication server , specifically the sessionIdUnauthenticatedUnusedLifetime property which is measured in seconds. As an example, if this value is 120, any attempt to authenticate taking more than two minutes will throw an error page. Moreover, a flow may specify its own timeout in the header . In practice, the effective timeout is the smallest value between sessionIdUnauthenticatedUnusedLifetime and the value supplied in the header, if any. Depending on specific needs, sessionIdUnauthenticatedUnusedLifetime may have to be set to a higher value than the server's default.

The course of this flow, and generally of any other, can be studied in three stages: From authentication request to bridge script Within Agama engine From bridge script to authentication server Stage 1 # In normal circumstances the flow is launched through a web browser via an OIDC authentication request which in turn activates the Agama bridge script. Its associated (facelet) page is agama.xhtml that invokes the prepareForStep method of that script. This method performs some initialization and makes a redirection to the URL /jans-auth/fl/agama.fls to hand the control to the Agama engine. Stage 2 # Note A preliminary reading of concepts presented in flows lifecycle is recommended before proceeding First request cycle # The GET request for agama.fls is processed by this servlet . Most of logic takes place at method startFlow of FlowService bean. Here, the associated data of the flow in question is retrieved from the database. Its transpiled code in addition to utility code ( util.js ) is loaded and the main entry point called - see invocation of callFunctionWithContinuations . This will throw a ContinuationPending exception once the equivalent instruction to RRF (or RFAC ) is found in the transpiled code. The above means that at line 6 of Hello world , the DSL code execution is interrupted: method processPause collects the required data for template rendering, like template location and its associated data model. This is saved to permanent storage in addition to the \"state of the program\", that is the values of all variables defined so far in the flow - this is known as the \"continuation\". Finally the ExecutionServlet sends a response consisting of a redirect. This completes the first request/response of this flow. Second request cycle # As a consequence of the HTTP redirect received, the browser will request the server a URL like /jans-auth/fl/hello/index.fls . Note how this is correlated to the template path defined in the flow. Here the GET handler of ExecutionServlet takes control again, this time calling the sendPageContents method defined in the parent class BaseServlet . sendPageContents performs the actual page rendering - specifically for hello/index.ftlh in this case - and the produced markup is sent to browser. So far we have \"covered\" the first two letters of the RRF instruction. Third cycle # Once the browser displays the page contents and the user hits the submit button, a new request cycle begins, this time POSTing to /jans-auth/fl/hello/index.fls . The method continueFlow of ExecutionServlet is called by the POST handler. Here the parameters of the payload are parsed and the continueFlow method of FlowService called in turn. At FlowService the continuation is restored and the transpiled flow code resumed (see resumeContinuation usage). This means that statements after the RRF instruction are all executed until another RRF or RFAC call is reached. However in this case, there are only a couple of statements left: Log and Finish . The value supplied for the latter, namely \"john_doe\" - a shortcut for { success: true, data: { userId: \"john_doe\" } } - is wrapped in the NativeObject instance resulting from the resumeContinuation call. Note If we had another RRF instruction in this flow, a ContinuationPending exception would have been thrown, as in the first request , and a redirection sent to browser.

In short, the following are the steps required to build a flow: Design and code the flow Add the flow to the server Upload flow assets (templates, images, Java libs and classes, etc.) Trigger an authentication request Apply flow updates As usual, several iterations will take place until you get it right. Note Throughout this document it is assumed you have a working single VM standard Janssen installation Design and code # It is up to developers how to design. This will normally require identifying the several \"steps\" that make up a flow and the conditions upon which \"branching\" takes place. Also it is important to check already existing flows in the server that may be reused for the purpose. Agama DSL was made to structure flows only, not for doing general purpose programming. This means developers have to use Java for doing low-level computations. This way, the resulting implementation (in DSL) serves as a depiction of the flow itself, hiding most of the internal details. Knowledge of the DSL is a requirement as consequence of the above. Fortunately Agama is small and very easy to learn. Check the DSL basics here . Also the \"Hello World\" sample flow will give you a first impresssion on the language. Currently there are no IDE/editor plugins for coding in Agama available. We hope to deliver tools in the future to ease the development experience. About crashes # As a flow executes things can go wrong for reasons that developers cannot foresee. A database may have crashed, a connection to an external system may have failed, the flow engine may have some bug, etc. When an abnormal situation is presented, a flow simply crashes. If a flow crashes, its parent flows (or flow) if they exist, crash as well. Trying to handle crashes involves a lot of planning and work which is too costly and will unlikely account for the so many things that might fail in a real setting. Thus, coding defensively is not recommended. While in Agama is possible to deal with Java exceptions, that feature should be used sparingly. Creating a flow # In order to manage flows, developers interact with a small REST API. Click here to learn about the requisites to access this API and here to check the respective open API definition - locate the endpoints starting with /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama . There are two ways available to add a flow: Endpoint Payload's content type Method Description /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/{qname} text/plain POST Creates a flow with the supplied qualified name ( qname ) and source code passed in the payload /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama application/json POST Creates a flow with the data supplied in the payload Notes: Ensure the tokens used have scope https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.write The response of a successful operation returns a 201 status code (i.e. created) and a JSON representation of the created flow - source code not included. If some fields result unfamiliar to you, consult the swagger (open api) document linked above A 400 response (i.e. bad request) is generally obtained when the input source code has syntax problems Examples: Creates a flow named com.acme.myflow using as source the data stored in file flow.txt curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' --data-binary @flow.txt https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/com.acme.myflow Creates a flow based on the data stored in file flow.js curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d@flow.js https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama where flow.js might look like this: { \"qname\": \"com.acme.myflow\", \"source\": \"Flow com.acme.myflow\\n\\tBasepath \\\"\\\"\\n\\nin = { name: \\\"John\\\" }\\nRRF \\\"index.ftlh\\\" in\\n\\nFinish \\\"john_doe\\\"\", \"enabled\": true, \"metadata\": { \"displayName\": \"Biometric authentication\", \"author\": \"John\", \"description\": \"This has not been written yet\", \"properties\": { \"api_key\": \"e2987c51\", \"secret\": \"change it\" } } } Notes: Only qname and source are required in the JSON payload properties in metadata refers to the configuration parameters of the flow. See Configs keyword here If enabled is absent, a false value is used by default in the JSON-based endpoint. The text-based version always assumes true . This property allows or prevents launching a flow directly from the browser Upload required assets # Note For convenience, references to the directory /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama will be replaced by <AGAMA-DIR> here onwards. The Basepath directive determines where flow assets reside. Ensure to create the given directory under <AGAMA-DIR>/ftl . Probably the same has to be done under <AGAMA-DIR>/fl . The difference between ftl and fl is subtle but important: the former directory must hold Freemarker templates while the latter assets like stylesheets, images and javascript code. This separation avoids Jetty server to expose the raw source code of your templates whose corresponding URL would be quite easy to guess. As an example, suppose your Basepath is foo and you have the instructions RRF index.ftlh and RRF bar/index2.ftlh somewhere in your code. Then your local <AGAMA-DIR>/ftl should look like: foo |- index.ftlh +- bar \\- index2.ftlh Say index.ftlh has markup like <img src=\"bar/me.png\"> and index2.ftlh has <link href=\"my/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> somewhere. This is how <AGAMA-DIR>/fl should look like: foo +- bar |- me.png \\- my \\- style.css Correspondence to URLs # In practice, assets will map directly under the URL https://<your-host>/jans-auth/fl . This means that to access me.png per the example above, is a matter of hitting https://<your-host>/jans-auth/fl/foo/bar/me.png in your browser. Trying to get access to templates in <AGAMA-DIR>/ftl directly is not possible. Running a flow # The quick start guide exemplifies how to run a flow and provides links to sample applications that can be used to play around with authentication in any OpenId Connect-compliant server like Janssen.

Flow updates # Important Ensure you have read about the requisites to access the REST API You may like to make modifications and enhancements to your flow. There are two ways to do so: Endpoint Payload's content type Method Description /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/source/{qname} text/plain PUT Updates the source code of the flow identified by the given qualified name ( qname ) with the value passed in the payload /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/{qname} application/json-patch+json PATCH Modifies the flow identified by the given qualified name ( qname ) using the JSON patch provided in the payload. See RFC 6902 Notes: Ensure the tokens used have scope https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.write Altering the source code of a flow via PATCH is possible but requires transforming the code into a (one liner) JSON string; this will be a repetitive burden. The PUT version is clearly more straightforward. If you still want to use PATCH, ensure to also modify the integer property revision increasing it by one. This will ensure the source changes are effectively picked. The response of a successful operation returns a 200 status code and a JSON representation of the updated flow - source code not included A 400 response (i.e. bad request) is generally obtained if the supplied source code was has syntax problems Examples: Modifies the flow com.acme.myflow replacing its source with the data stored in file flow.txt curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -X PUT --data-binary @flow.txt https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/source/com.acme.myflow Applies a series of modifications to the flow com.acme.myflow : nullifies its description, sets the value of configuration properties, and modifies the creation timestamp to Aug 8th 23:06:40 UTC curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json-patch+json' -X PATCH -d@patch.js https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/com.acme.myflow where patch.js contents are: [ { \"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/metadata/description\" }, { \"op\":\"replace\", \"path\": \"/metadata/properties\", \"value\": { \"string_key1\": \"value_1\", \"number_key2\": 10 } }, { \"op\":\"replace\", \"path\": \"/metadata/timestamp\", \"value\": 1660000000000 } ] Flow retrieval and removal # Important Ensure you have read about the requisites to access the REST API There are two endpoints for retrieval: Endpoint Method Description /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama GET Retrieves all flows' data /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/{qname} GET Retrieves the data of the flow identified by the given qualified name ( qname ) Notes: Ensure the tokens used have scope https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.readonly The response of a successful operation returns a 200 status code with a JSON representation of the flow(s). If some fields result unfamiliar to you, consult the swagger (open api) document linked above By default the source code is not included (this may clutter the output considerably). Append ?includeSource=true to the endpoint URL to have the source in the output Example: Retrieve the data associated to the flow com.acme.myflow including its source code curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/com.acme.myflow?includeSource=true There is one endpoint to remove a flow: Endpoint Method Description /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/{qname} DELETE Removes the flow identified by the given qualified name ( qname ) Notes : Ensure the tokens used have scope https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.delete The output of a successful removal is 204 (no content) Example: Remove the the flow com.acme.myflow curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -X DELETE https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/com.acme.myflow About syntax errors # Every time a flow is created or updated, a preliminar syntax check on the flow code is performed. If an error is found, the response will contain details that include the location (line and column) of the problem in the source code. By design Agama is a transpiled language and transpilation occurs in the background - in the form of a timer task. This task involves processes that go beyond the checks applied upon flow creation or update. When an error is detected at transpilation time, two things can occur: If this was the first transpilation attempt, i.e. it's a recently created flow, a message like \"Source code has errors\" will appear in the browser when launching the flow Otherwise, no error is shown and the flow will behave as if no changes had been applied to the flow's code. This helps preserve the last known \"healthy\" state of your flow so end-users are not impacted In any case, the cause of the error can be inspected by retrieving the flow's data and checking the property codeError .","title":"Development Lifecycle"},{"location":"admin/developer/agama/lifecycle/#development-lifecycle","text":"In this page an overview of the flow development process is presented.

This task involves processes that go beyond the checks applied upon flow creation or update. When an error is detected at transpilation time, two things can occur: If this was the first transpilation attempt, i.e. it's a recently created flow, a message like \"Source code has errors\" will appear in the browser when launching the flow Otherwise, no error is shown and the flow will behave as if no changes had been applied to the flow's code.

In Agama, templates must reside in the filesystem under /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl directory. All the other assets (CSS, JS, etc.) are expected to be under /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/fl . Java classes # Agama DSL supports calling Java code - it is designed to force developers use Java when tasks cannot be implemented by simple data manipulation or comparison of values. Any public class or interface in the classpath of jans-auth webapp can be used for this purpose. Additionally the classpath can be augmented by uploaded source files on the fly. Click here to learn more. Client application # This is the target application that end-users will get access to after a successful authentication. In OpenId Connect terms, a \"Relying Party\" or RP. It is advisable to have this application ready before proceeding to the next section of this document. Depending on the tools and acquaintance with OpenId Connect protocol, this may take some time for developers. Note it may also require to apply configurations in the (Janssen) server for this purpose. A low resistance path we recommend is trying the stripped down Javascript client example by Nat Sakimura. Here, the discovery URL is your server's URL. Another alternative is trying mod_auth_openidc , an Apache 2 server module that implements RP functionality. Hello world sample flow # Your first taste of Agama will be through a dummy \"hello world\" flow. Here, the end-user will be presented a salutation page with a submit button which once pressed, will finish the process. For the sake of simplicity, the user to be authenticated will be a hardcoded one. This way we avoid gathering data at the browser and any other further processing in order to keep the example as short and simple as possible. Note While in most cases flows need to externally \"receive\" data and configuration parameters to properly drive their behavior, this is not the case here. The flow will only show a static salutation message and will terminate logging in a certain user, if existing. Flow code # The source code (written in agama DSL dialect) is shown below. Note the absence of parenthesis and semicolons - in general the syntax is very lightweight. A line-by-line description follows: Line 2: every flow starts with the Flow keyword followed by a qualified name (think of it as the flow identifier) Line 3: Basepath specifies the directory where the assets of this flow reside. Note this is part of an indented block. There are more directives that may go here but they are beyond scope right now. Basepath is always mandatory. Line 4: empty. There can be any number of empty lines in a source file Line 5: an assignment to a variable. Agama is dynamically typed and variables are not declared. Here in is a map (a collection of key/value pairs). Note its resemblance to JSON. in has no special meaning, we could have used x , Soup , or whatever_123 . Line 6: RRF is used to send a response to the user's browser: it takes the path to a template ( hello/index.ftlh ) and injects a value into it ( in in this case). The produced ( R endered) markup is sent ( R eplied) to the browser. Finally, the result of the interaction of the user with the page can be retrieved ( F etched), however, this is skipped here because we are no capturing anything at the client side. The contents of index.ftlh should be familiar to web developers. The ${...} notation is used to dynamically insert values in the markup: the text John in this case. Expressions like this are integral part of Freemarker. Once form submission occurs, flow execution continues at line 8. Line 8: a logging statement. This appends the text Done! to the flow's log. The Log instruction is pretty versatile; it is used in its simplest form here. Line 9: marks the flow ending. Finish has several forms but here a shorthand notation is used where we always report a positive success and supply the identifier of a user. If it turns out your local user database contains a user identified by john_doe , this will be the subject that will get authenticated by the server, otherwise an error page will be shown. This flow is extremely static and unrealistic but showcases minimal key elements for flow building. Please do not try this flow in any of your production servers. Getting an access token # In order to add/modify flows, you will interact with a small REST API which is protected by bearer token. To be able to get tokens, SSH to your server and perform the following steps: Run python3 /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py In the menu enter to OAuth > OIDC clients > Get list of clients Accept the default parameters, for pattern enter config Follow the instructions (in a web browser) to get authorized access A list of results will be shown, pick the value in the inum column for the client with display name Jans Config Api Client Choose back , and enter to Get client by inum Enter the collected inum and grab the value of clientSecret in the resulting JSON document Finally, choose logout and quit The collected secret is encoded, run python3 /opt/jans/bin/encode.py -D <clientSecret> to decode it. The following is an example of how to get a token using curl . Replace data in the placeholders appropriately: curl -u '<client-inum:client-secret-decoded>' -d scope='https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.write' -d grant_type=client_credentials https://<your-host>/jans-auth/restv1/token You can extract the token from the (JSON) response obtained which is a self-explanatory. Add the -k switch if your server uses a self-signed certificate. Tokens are required to have the right scopes depending on the operation to invoke, the following table summarizes this aspect: scope permission allowed https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.readonly Retrieve flow data https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.write Create or modify a flow https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.delete Remove a flow You can find here the open API definition of the REST API - locate the endpoints starting with /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama . Notes : Tokens have expiration time measured in seconds. When expired, you'll have to re-request To get a token with more than one scope, supply the required scopes separated by whitespace in the scope parameter of the request above You don't have to necessarily use the jans-config-api client to get your tokens. Any client, including one registered yourself can be used here as long as it can provide the needed scopes Add the flow to the server # The easiest way to create a flow is issuing a POST passing the source code in the payload. For our example, if the flow's source code resides in a file named flow.txt , the request would look this way: curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' --data-binary @flow.txt https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/test (the -i switch is useful to check the HTTP headers sent with the response). Notes: test (the qualified named) was supplied as the last component of the URL to send the POST to The expected status code of the response is 201 (i.e. created) unless there was some problem to process the request. Particularly, if 401 (unauthorized) was obtained, it means your token is no longer valid A successful response contains a summary (in JSON format) of the flow created If we had to modify the code of this flow, a similar operation could be used: curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -X PUT --data-binary @flow.txt https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/source/test /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/source is a dedicated endpoint that replaces a flow's code whose name is supplied in the end of the URL. If things went wrong and you want to start all over again, you can easily remove the flow like this (ensuring the token has the right scope): curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -X DELETE https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/test The status code of a successful removal is 204 (empty). To retrieve the flow's data, a request like the below can be used: curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/test Note the source code is not part of the response by default. Append ?includeSource=true to the URL for the source to be included. Important There are different, more detailed ways to retrieve, create and update flows but they are regarded in the Development lifecycle doc page. Finally the flow assets must be uploaded. You can SFTP/SCP or use other means to do so. In our example, only two steps are required: Create a directory hello under /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl Upload the template there Craft an authentication request # This section assumes your client application is ready, or at least you have made the configurations required so that you can trigger an (OpendId Connect) authentication request. This usually boils down to create and launch a URL looking like https://<your-host>/jans-auth/restv1/authorize?acr_values=agama&customParam1=test&scope=...&response_type=...&redirect_uri=https...&client_id=...&state=... . You may like to check the spec for more details, however, keep in mind that: To trigger an Agama flow, the acr_values parameter must be equal to agama The identifier (qualified name) of the flow to trigger is passed using an already registered custom parameter. By now it suffices to say that customParam1 will work in most installations. Note the parameter value in the example equals the name given to the Hello World flow If the flow to call receives input parameters, their values can be passed in the custom parameter as well. Use a hyphen to separate the flow name and the parameters expressed in JSON object format. For example, if the flow had inputs height and color , you can use test-{\"height\": 190, \"color\": \"blue\"} for the value of customParam1 . Ensure to apply proper URL-encoding beforehand. In this case, the actual value would be test-%7B%22height%22%3A+190%2C+%22color%22%3A+%22blue%22%7D . If certain inputs are not provided, null values will be assigned for them Testing # Launch the authentication request in a web browser - preferably in a private window, a.k.a. incognito. You will be taken to a plain HTML page with a salutation and a \"continue\" button. After submission, a quick \"Redirecting you\" page will be shown and you will be taken probably to an error page showing \"Unable to determine identity of user\". That's expected. Let's start by changing the salutation. Download the source code and template . In a text editor, modify line 5 of the source by changing the name surrounded by double quotes to a different word. Save the file and send the update as regarded in Add the flow to the server . Wait for one minute. Generate an authentication request again and launch it. You will be able to see the changes. Feel free to edit index.ftlh and re-upload - templates changes are picked up immediately. Now pick an existing username from your user base and alter the flow's code so that such user gets authenticated. Edit line 9 for this purpose, for example, Finish \"admin\" . If things went fine, after the form submission your browser should have been taken to the redirect_uri defined for the authentication request. Depending on how evolved your client application is, it may have created a session for such user and obtained profile data already!.

Basic authentication # This is the simplest form of authentication where end-users gain access to a protected resource (e.g. an application) by providing a valid username and password combination. In this example users will be given three attempts at most to supply valid credentials, otherwise an error page will be shown. Implementation # Source code here . Lines 1-2. Flow declarations for qualified name ( io.jans.flow.sample.basic ) and assets folder ( samples/basic ) Lines 4-5. Obtains a reference to the server's CDI bean AuthenticationService . This object will allow to perform username/password validation. The object's class - AuthenticationService.class - is obtained at line 4 and the actual instance is obtained at line 5 by means of lookup carried out by method bean of CdiUtil class. For more information on the server CDI beans visit this page Line 6. Initializes an empty map. It will be passed as data model for the UI page later Line 8. Declares that the block of indented statements (lines 9-14) will be executed repeatedly three times at most Line 9. Renders the template login.ftlh passing obj as data model. The form fields the user will fill at the browser are to be stored at variable creds Line 10. Calls the authenticate method on asrv (the AuthenticationService bean) passing the username and password (sent by the user's browser) as parameters. Note the presence of form fields username and password in the UI template. The boolean value returned by this method is stored in the key success of map obj and determines if the username and password combination supplied was valid Line 11. The username is copied to key uid of map obj . Note the usage of uid in the template: this is used to populate the username field in the case the first authentication attempt is not successful Lines 13-14. If the credentials supplied were valid, the flow is finished successfully attaching the username of the user in question. This is needed for the authentication server to determine who is logging in Line 16. If this line is reached in a flow execution, it means the three attempts were invalid. In this case the flow is finished with failure UI template # login.ftlh is 99% HTML markup and will not be detailed here. There are only a couple of things to highlight: The conditional <#if !(success!true)> (around line 27) is used to determine if an error message should be included in the generated markup. It works this way: if the key success exists in this template data model, its value is negated (note the bang character before the left parenthesis) and the if condition is evaluated. If non-existing, a true value is assumed which is then negated and thus the if body will not be evaluated- Expressions of the form ${msgs[...]} are used to access string messages defined in the server resource bundle. For more information visit \"Writing UI pages\" . The expression ${uid!} (around line 35) is equivalent to ${uid!\"\"} and evaluates to the value of key uid . In case uid is not defined, an empty string value is used. Email OTP authentication # This is a two-stepped flow where the end-user initially is prompted to enter a username and corresponding password. Upon successful validation and assuming the user has an e-mail designated in his profile, a message with a one-time passcode (OTP) is sent to his inbox. The user is expected to enter the code in the browser to complete the authentication. Implementation # Note Acquaintance with the basic authentication flow is required to understand this flow Source code here . Lines 1-2. Flow declarations for qualified name ( io.jans.flow.sample.otp.email ) and assets folder ( samples/otp-email ) Line 5. The basic authentication flow is launched. Its output stored in variable obj Lines 6-7. If basic authentication didn't succeed, this flows finishes in the same way Line 9. The user identifier is grabbed from the basic flow output and stored in userId Line 10. The e-mail of the user identified by userId is obtained by calling method emailOf of class EmailOTPUtil . Source code here . This time the managed bean UserService is used. Copy EmailOTPUtil.java directly to folder /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/scripts/io/jans/agama/samples of your server Lines 12-14. If the user does not have a designated e-mail address, the flow is finished Lines 16-18. Initializes utility variables and declares that the block of indented statements (lines 20-35) will be executed repeatedly three times at most Lines 20-22. Sends a message with a passcode to the e-mail of the user (stored in variable email ) by calling method send of class EmailOTPUtil . If delivery was successful this method returns the passcode sent, otherwise null . The value is store in otpCode variable Lines 24-26. If delivery failed, the flow is finished Line 28. Renders the template otp.ftlh passing obj as data model. After form submission, obj will have up to two keys: passcode and resend . The former will hold whatever the user entered in the passcode text field, and the latter will exist if the \"resend code\" link was clicked Line 31. Variable sendEmail is set to true if the user clicked on the \"resend code\" link Line 33-35. If the passcode entered in the text field matches the value of the passcode sent in the e-mail (variable otpCode ) the flow finishes successfully indicating the identity of the user (previously stored in userId ). Otherwise key matches is attached to map obj with value false . This key is employed in the template (around line 27) to show an error message in case the user entered a wrong code Lines 37-38. If execution reaches this point, it means the form was submitted three times and no matching code was entered. In this case, flow is finished accordingly (failed) UI template # otp.ftlh is on the same lines of the template used in the basic authentication flow. Here the form has three relevant elements: A textfield to enter the passcode (around line 35) A standard submission button (around line 41) A button with type=submit and id=resend rendered as a hypertext link (around line 47). Only when the link is clicked, resend parameter will be part of the request sent to the server If the user presses the enter key when the focus is on the text field, the form is submitted by means of the standard submission button. Combined registration and authentication flow # In this flow features like template overrides and flow cancellation are leveraged to bring a more sophisticated authentication journey. A description follows: A login form (username/password) is shown with an auxiliary link to offer account registration If the registration link is clicked, the user is shown a page that prompts personal details in order to create an account Upon successful account creation, a \"continue to login\" page is presented The OTP authentication flow of the previous section is reused: a standard login form is shown and then the user is prompted to enter a passcode. Registration # For the purposes of registration, a small flow was created: This flow is pretty simple and we are not going into the details here. Keep in mind the following: Upload confirmation.ftlh and index.ftlh files to folder /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl/samples/registration Copy the file RegistrationUtil.java to directory /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/io/jans/agama/samples Keep this flow disabled. If used standalone, it will finish but no actual person will be authenticated. It is not designed to be used directly but by other flows. Main flow # Source code here . This flow is short and powerful. To start it launches the email OTP authentication flow (line 4). However, instead of the login.ftlh template used internally by the basic flow, a different version is used (line 5). The new template is located in this flow's basepath, i.e. samples/otp-email-registration , and the file name does not change. This new page simply adds a small link that reads \"Don't have an account?\" in a new HTML form. When clicked it will provoke the email-OTP flow to be aborted early and the condition at line 7 will be truthy. If that's not the case, the email-OTP flow will proceed as usual and the current flow will finish in the same way as email-OTP (line 16). If email-OTP is aborted, the registration flow that we just saw is launched (line 9). Here the template confirmation.ftlh is overriden too (line 10). This new page changes the label of the button that is shown after an account has been created: originally the text is \"Continue\" but for the current flow, \"Proceed to login\" is a better fit. If the registration flow finishes successfully (line 12), the email-OTP flow is triggered again (line 14) - this time without customizations. Then the user can supply his recently-created credentials to get past the basic authentication stage and finally move to the OTP challenge. Recall that via registration flow the user's e-mail address is already stored in the database. Finally, the current flow finishes identically as email-OTP did (line 16).","title":"Sample Flows"},{"location":"admin/developer/agama/samples/#sample-flows","text":"This page provides some practical flow examples to help readers in their process of learning Agama.

Depending on the sophistication required for the UI/UX, more effort might be demanded, however with Agama, developers focus more on writing HTML markup than dealing with complexities of a UI framework. Here, there is considerably less wrestling in comparison to using big frameworks like JSF. Template engine # To generate all output to be sent to the browser, the Apache FreeMarker template engine is used. This is a lightweight, versatile, and easy-to-learn open-source Java library. With FreeMarker any kind of text output can be produced, so Agama flows are not restricted to HTML markup exclusively. Developers are encouraged to take a peep at the FreeMarker manual before trying to write their first pages. The key concept there is Template + data-model = output which is pretty natural. The sumation in this equation is generally referred to as \"rendering a template\" in this documentation. The following resources are useful as introduction as well: The Hello World flow presented in the quick start guide. Pay attention to the RRF instruction there Agama sample flows As you will see, the task boils down to produce the desired markup plus adding some placeholders for information that is dynamic. Data model # In Agama, every template is generally \"injected\" some data, see RRF . This data in FreeMarker terms is known as \"data-model\". In practice, this will be an agama map which can be accessed from the templates using standard FreeMarker notation. This map is attached a couple of additional keys for developer's convenience: webCtx . It gives easy access to often needed bits like current path, locale, etc. This is a Java object you can inspect here . Take a look at the getters; writing ${webCtx.contextPath} in a template will insert the result of calling method getContextPath - normally the string /jans-auth . msgs . It gives access to the localized messages of jans-auth application. Some developers might know this as the \"internationalization labels\" or \"resource bundle\" of an application. This is a collection of .properties files where common UI-related messages in different languages can be found. A message (label) is identified by a key, so in a template ${msgs.<KEY>} could be used. As most keys in resource bundles have dot characters, the alternative notation ${webCtx[\"KEY\"]} works better for FreeMarker, for example ${msgs[\"login.errorMessage\"]} . Output encoding # The character encoding of the response sent to browser is by default UTF-8 . To specify a different encoding the ftl directive can be used, for instance, <#ftl encoding=\"ISO-8859-5\"> . Place this at the top of the template. Reusable templates # A widespread practice in web page authoring is to compose pages based on reusable pieces. As an example, the need for a common header and footer is ubiquitous in HTML projects. With FreeMarker, composition can be achieved by means of macros . These are the equivalent to functions in programming, they can generate output based on parameters passed and can be called anywhere in a template. Agama already makes use of macros for this purpose. Take a look at the ftlh files found at /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama . These templates are used to present errors, like timeouts, flow crashes, etc. Example # Here, two pages will be built to demostrate the concept of composition in FreeMarker templates: a homepage and an \"about us\" page. These will be made up of a header, a sidebar, and their respective main content. Assume the sidebar should be shown only for the home page.

It works like the homepage except the sidebar will not be shown. Assets # Web pages need their assets, be they stylesheets, images, or javascript. The template engine has no restrictions in this regard. The main concern is producing proper markup. Keep in mind assets are not stored alongisde the templates but in the parallel folder /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/fl . Check here to learn more. Template overrides # Template overrides is a mechanism that allows templates customization and promotes flows reuse. If an existing flow serves well the needs of a new flow you are writing, with this feature you can homogenize your UI for a more pleasant user experience. To start, use Trigger to play around with the existing flow - as is - from the flow you are creating. Collect the URLs of the pages you are not comfortable with: grab them directly from the browser's address bar. Then proceed as follows with every URL to locate the actual templates physically: Remove the https://.../fl/ portion of the URL Split the URL obtained into two pieces: a folder name and a remainder . The remainder starts after the last slash found in the URL, and usually ends in .fls In your Janssen server, locate the directory /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl cd to the directory specified by the folder List the contents of the directory and pick the filename that best matches the remainder Save a copy of every selected file in the directory associated to your flow ( basePath directive) or in a subdirectory of it. Rename the files if desired too. Now, build the Override templates directive passing several pairs of strings separated by lines or spaces. Every pair consists of a string specifying the original template location, that is, <folder>/<filename> followed by the path to the new template version relative to the base path of your flow.

If an existing flow serves well the needs of a new flow you are writing, with this feature you can homogenize your UI for a more pleasant user experience. To start, use Trigger to play around with the existing flow - as is - from the flow you are creating. Collect the URLs of the pages you are not comfortable with: grab them directly from the browser's address bar. Then proceed as follows with every URL to locate the actual templates physically: Remove the https://.../fl/ portion of the URL Split the URL obtained into two pieces: a folder name and a remainder . The remainder starts after the last slash found in the URL, and usually ends in .fls In your Janssen server, locate the directory /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl cd to the directory specified by the folder List the contents of the directory and pick the filename that best matches the remainder Save a copy of every selected file in the directory associated to your flow ( basePath directive) or in a subdirectory of it. Rename the files if desired too. Now, build the Override templates directive passing several pairs of strings separated by lines or spaces. Every pair consists of a string specifying the original template location, that is, <folder>/<filename> followed by the path to the new template version relative to the base path of your flow.

Token introspection allows a protected resource to query this information. Introspection scripts allows to modify response of Introspection Endpoint spec and present additional meta information surrounding the token.

FIDO2 is comprised of the W3C\u2019s Web Authentication specification (WebAuthn) and FIDO\u2019s corresponding Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) . WebAuthn defines a standard web API that can be built into browsers and related web platform infrastructure to enable online services to use FIDO Authentication. CTAP enables external devices such as mobile handsets or FIDO Security Keys to work with WebAuthn and serve as authenticators to desktop applications and web services. This document explains how to use the Janssen Auth Server's built-in FIDO2 interception script to implement a two-step, two-factor authentication (2FA) with username / password as the first step, and any FIDO2 device as the second step. Prerequisites # A Janssen Server ( installation instructions ) FIDO2 interception script (included in the default Janssen Server distribution); At least one FIDO2 device for testing, like one of the devices listed below . FIDO2 devices # Some well known FIDO2 devices and manufacturers include: Yubico Vasco DIGIPASS SecureClick HyperFIDO Feitian Technologies AuthenTrend Apple's built-in Touch ID Purchase FIDO2 devices on Amazon . Or, check FIDO's certified products for a comprehensive list of FIDO2 devices (sort by Specification == FIDO2 ). Properties # The script has the following properties Property Description Example fido2_server_uri URL of the Janssen's FIDO2 server https://idp.mycompany.com Enable FIDO2 script # By default, users will get the default authentication mechanism as specified above. However, using the OpenID Connect acr_values parameter, web and mobile clients can request any enabled authentication mechanism . Obtain the json contents of fido2 custom script by using a jans-cli command like get-config-scripts-by-type , get-config-scripts-by-inum etc. e.g : /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id get-config-scripts-by-type --url-suffix type:PERSON_AUTHENTICATION , /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id get-config-scripts-by-inum --url-suffix inum:6122281b-b55d-4dd0-8115-b098eeeee2b7 Update the custom script and change the enabled attribute to true Now FIDO2 is an available authentication mechanism for your Janssen Server. This means that, using OpenID Connect acr_values , applications can now request FIDO2 authentication for users. Note To make sure FIDO2 has been enabled successfully, you can check your Janssen's Auth Server OpenID Connect configuration by navigating to the following URL: https://<hostname>/.well-known/openid-configuration . Find \"acr_values_supported\": and you should see \"fido2\" . Enable FIDO2 Script as default authentication script: # Use this link as a reference. Follow the steps below to enable FIDO2 authentication: 1. Create a file say fido2-auth-default.json with the following contents { \"defaultAcr\": \"fido2\" } 2.Update the default authentication method to fido2 /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id put-acrs --data /tmp/fido2-auth-default.json Note If FIDO2 is set as a default authentication mechanism users will not be able to access the protected resource(s) while using a mobile device or a browser that does not support FIDO2 (e.g. Internet Explorer). FIDO2 login page # Below is an illustration of the Janssen Server's default FIDO2 login page: The design is being rendered from the FIDO2 xhtml page . To customize the look and feel of this page, follow the customization guide . Using FIDO2 tokens # Credential enrollment # FIDO2 device enrollment happens during the first authentication attempt. Subsequent authentications # All subsequent FIDO2 authentications for that user account will require the enrolled FIDO2 key.

The authentication flow in the Jans Server is driven by the openID spec. The authorization request to the OP (Jans server) contains an optional query parameter called acr_values which is used by the OP to pick an interception script which will be run when /authorize endpoint (Authentication flow) is invoked. The name of each script corresponds with its acr value in the Jans-Auth Server. Typically, a PersonAuthenticationType script can be used to: 1. introduce a new 2FA authentication mechanism 2. customise multistep authentication 3. offer Social logins 4. proactively perform fraud detection and block the user. Default authentication method: # In an OpenID Connect authentication request, one of the optional parameters defined is acr_values . This is the primary way for a client to signal to the OpenID Provider (OP) the preferred way to authenticate the subject. A client may also specify default_acr_values during registration (and omit the parameter while making an authentication request). In the Jansssen Server configuration, acr is used to name the authentication workflow. default_acr : This is the default authentication mechanism exposed to all applications that send users to the Janssen Server for sign-in. Unless an app specifically requests a different form of authentication using the OpenID Connect acr_values parameter (as specified below), users will receive the form of authentication specified in this field. If a default ACR is not specified, Janssen will determine it based on enabled scripts and the internal user/password ACR. This internal ACR, simple_password_auth , is set to level -1. This means that it has lower priority than any scripts, so Janssen server will use it only if no other authentication method is set. Use the jans-cli to update / look-up the default authentication method . Multiple Authentication Mechanisms # The Jans Server can concurrently support multiple authentication mechanisms, enabling Web and mobile apps (clients) to request a specific type of authentication using the standard OpenID Connect request parameter: acr_value. Enabling an authentication mechanism # By default, users will get the default authentication mechanism as specified above. However, using the OpenID Connect acr_values parameter, web and mobile clients can request any enabled authentication mechanism . Obtain the json contents of a custom script by using a jans-cli command like get-config-scripts-by-type , get-config-scripts-by-inum etc. Example : /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id get-config-scripts-by-type --url-suffix type:PERSON_AUTHENTICATION /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id get-config-scripts-by-inum --url-suffix inum:6122281b-b55d-4dd0-8115-b098eeeee2b7 Update the custom script and change the enabled attribute to true Level (rank) of an Authentication mechanism : # Each authentication mechanism has a \"Level\" assigned to it which describes how secure and strict it is. The higher the \"Level\", the more reliable mechanism represented by the script is. Though several mechanisms can be enabled at the same Janssen server instance at the same time, for any specific user's session only one of them can be set as the current one (and will be returned as acr claim of id_token for them). If after initial session is created a new authorization request from a RP comes in specifying another authentication method, its \"Level\" will be compared to that of the method currently associated with this session. If requested method's \"Level\" is lower or equal to it, nothing is changed and the usual SSO behavior is observed. If it's higher (i.e. a more secure method is requested), it's not possible to serve such request using the existing session's context, and user must re-authenticate themselves to continue. If they succeed, a new session becomes associated with that requested mechanism instead. Enabled scripts can be confirmed by checking the Janssen OP configuration URL, https://<hostname>/.well-known/openid-configuration , and finding the \" acr_values_supported \". Learn more about acr_values in the OpenID Connect core spec . Building blocks of an authentication workflow # A. Custom script B. UI pages, stylesheets, javascript files, image files and resource bundles C. Managed Beans D. Third party libraries. Jans-auth comprises of a number of beans, configuration files and Facelets (JSF) views, packaged as a WAR module. That means custom scripts and custom pages (JSF facelets) can make use of business logic already encapsulated in the Weld managed beans. The following sections explain how authentication flow can be built using a custom script. Writing a custom script # The PersonAuthenticationType script is described by a java interface whose methods should be overridden to implement an authentication workflow. The article talks about these methods in detail and the psuedo code in each method will help drive home the point. Writing UI pages: # All pages are xhtml files. The Jans-auth server comes with a default set of pages for login, logout, errors, authorizations. You can easily override these pages or write new ones. You can easily apply your own stylesheet, images and resouce-bundles to your pages. This article covers all the details you need to write your own web page. Building business logic in Custom script: # Jans-auth server uses Weld 3.0 (JSR-365 aka CDI 2.0) for managed beans. The most important aspects of business logic are implemented through a set of beans. Details and examples of this can be found in this article Adding libraries for use in the custom script # Java or Python libraries to be imported and used very easily. Remember incase you opt for a python library, it should be written in \"pure python\" only. More details of this mentioned here Uses of Person Authentication script # A. Implementing 2FA authentication mechanisms # FIDO2 : Authentications using platform authenticators embedded into a person's device or physical USB, NFC or Bluetooth security keys that are inserted into a USB slot of a computer SMS OTP : Email OTP B. Implementing Multistep authentication # Redirect to previous step : The script here an example of how the number of steps can be varied depending on the context or business requirement. C. Implementing Social logins # You can use a PersonAuthenticationType script to allow users to sign using credentials from popular Social Identity providers or Inbound Identity Providers like Facebook, Google and Apple. After users authenticate, thier Social Identity Provider credentials are provisioned into the Jans-auth server. More on this topic in this article D. Proactively perform fraud detection # Impossible travel Testing an authentication flow # An example of a complete URL looks like this - ``` https://<your.jans.server>/jans-auth/authorize.htm? \\ response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://<your.jans.server>/admin \\ &client_id=17b8b82e-b3ec-42a2-bd90-097028a37f3 \\ &scope=openid+profile+email+user_name \\ &state=faad2cdjfdddjfkdf&nonce=dajdffdfsdcfff ``` To test , enter the complete URL for authorization in a browser or create a simple webmapage with a link that simulates the user sign-in attempt. If the server is configured properly, the first page for the selected authentication method will be displayed to the user. FAQs # 1. How can error messages be displayed on a web page? # FacesMessage bean is used for this purpose. from org.jans.jsf2.message import FacesMessages from org.jans.service.cdi.util import CdiUtil from javax.faces.application import FacesMessage ... facesMessages = CdiUtil.bean(FacesMessages) facesMessages.setKeepMessages() facesMessages.add(FacesMessage.SEVERITY_ERROR, \"Please enter a valid username\") The error will appear in the associated template using the following markup: ... <h:messages /> ... See an example here 2. How is redirection to a third party application for authentication handled in a script? # For user authentication or consent gathering, there might be a need to redirect to a third party application to perform some operation and return the control back to authentication steps of the custom script.

The authentication flow in the Jans Server is driven by the openID spec.

The name of each script corresponds with its acr value in the Jans-Auth Server.

In the Jansssen Server configuration, acr is used to name the authentication workflow. default_acr : This is the default authentication mechanism exposed to all applications that send users to the Janssen Server for sign-in. Unless an app specifically requests a different form of authentication using the OpenID Connect acr_values parameter (as specified below), users will receive the form of authentication specified in this field. If a default ACR is not specified, Janssen will determine it based on enabled scripts and the internal user/password ACR. This internal ACR, simple_password_auth , is set to level -1.

If after initial session is created a new authorization request from a RP comes in specifying another authentication method, its \"Level\" will be compared to that of the method currently associated with this session. If requested method's \"Level\" is lower or equal to it, nothing is changed and the usual SSO behavior is observed. If it's higher (i.e. a more secure method is requested), it's not possible to serve such request using the existing session's context, and user must re-authenticate themselves to continue. If they succeed, a new session becomes associated with that requested mechanism instead.

Components # A Janssen auth Server (installation instructions here ) The Passport Social authentication script The Passport JS Project Authentication Flow # After users authenticate at the external social identity provider, the control flows back to Janssen Authentication server where the user is verified and the user-id is provisioned into the Janssen server. Diagram source file Role of Passport-JS project and Janssen's Authentication server # Passport-js project encrypts and signs user data before passing it to the Janssen server. Janssen Auth server verifies the received JWT, decrypts data, add/update user into LDAP, and marks the user as authenticated. Check Script Code For details. Diagram source file Setup and configurations # Setup Passport JS Project # Passport JS is very good library in Node JS which helps to add many social provider authentication in project. For this Inbound Jans Flow, You have to make a Passport Node JS project which help to generates auth request for your external social providers, get the user information, and send it to the Janssen server. Below things need to add in Passport JS Project to setup complete auth flow with Jans. Make a token endpoint which expose token with unique id. Jans will use this endpoint to get token and use this token for secur auth request. Passport Project has to validate this token in Jans request. This is just a simple strategy to protect passport endpoint from spam requests and only allow jans to request it. Code sample: // Encryption compatible with Jans EncryptionService // Salt File path: /etc/jans/conf/salt router . get ( '/token' , function ( req , res , next ) { const t = jwt . sign ( { jwt : uuidv4 () }, '<saltfilevalue>' , { expiresIn : 120 } // 2 min expiration ) res . status ( 200 ). send ({ token_ : t }) // key should be token_ } ) You need to use Salt File /etc/jans/conf/salt as a secret key. You will get this salt file after Jans intallation. Jans interception script uses this same file for decryption. Create auth request endpoints which will be request by User on Jans auth login page. For Example: Suppose you have added google strategy in your passport project. In that case you can make a endpoint like /google/:token . google is provider id in providers_json_file . token is the same token which we created in above step. After authentication Passport Project has to send encoded userinfo data to Jans https://<your.jans.server.com>/jans-auth/postlogin.htm . Below is the Node JS code sample to send POST request with data to Jans Post Login Endpoint. const postUrl = \"https://<your.jans.server.com>/jans-auth/postlogin.htm\" res . set ( 'content-type' , 'text/html;charset=UTF-8' ) return res . status ( 200 ). send ( ` <html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xml:lang=\"en\"> <body onload=\"document.forms[0].submit()\"> <noscript> <p> <b>Note:</b> your browser does not support JavaScript, please press the Continue button to proceed. </p> </noscript> <form action=\" ${ postUrl } \" method=\"post\"> <div> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"user\" value=\" ${ jwt } \"/> <noscript> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Continue\"/> </noscript> </div> </form> </body> </html>` ) Check next step to generate jwt . To make encoded userinfo data, use jwt private key signing technique. Check below sample code: // mapped user info data with ldap attributes const user = { uid : profile . username || profile . id , mail : profile . email , cn : profile . displayName , displayName : profile . displayName , givenName : profile . name . givenName , sn : profile . name . familyName , provider : \"<your-social-provider-name>\" , // e.g. google } jwt . sign ({ iss : 'https://<your.jans.server.com>/jans-auth/postlogin.htm' , sub : user . uid , aud : 'https://<your.jans.server.com>' , jti : uuidv4 (), exp : now / 1000 + 30 , iat : now , data : encrypt ( user ) }, privateKey , defaultRpOptions ) // Check `generate Keystore` section below to generate keys const privateKey = `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Your Private Key xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -----END PRIVATE KEY-----` cosnt defaultRpOptions = { algorithm : config . get ( 'keyAlg' ), header : { typ : 'JWT' , alg : config . get ( 'keyAlg' ), kid : config . get ( 'keyId' ) } } function encrypt ( obj ) { // Encryption compatible with Jans EncryptionService // Salt File path: /etc/jans/conf/salt const pt = JSON . stringify ( obj ) const encrypt = crypto . createCipheriv ( 'des-ede3-ecb' , '<saltfilevalue>' , '' ) let encrypted = encrypt . update ( pt , 'utf8' , 'base64' ) encrypted += encrypt . final ( 'base64' ) return encrypted } Follow Steps in Generate Keystore section to generate private key. You can add as many as possible passport strategies in your passport project. Above steps are little complex, use this sample code file to build your passport application. Apache proxy setup # For seamless flow, You can deploy Passport Project on Jans server and you can use an apache proxy pass to configure the passport with jans-server. Add the below configuration to the Janssen apache server and restart the apache server. <Location /passport> ProxyPass http://localhost:8090/passport retry=5 connectiontimeout=60 timeout=60 Order deny,allow Allow from all </Location> After this configurations, you need to use jans-fqdn in passport callback URL. This is optional configurations, you can deploy your passport project on another server. Add passport-social script # Download the script from here and add it to Janssen Server using jans-cli . After Janssen Server installation, you will get jans-cli . Follow this jans-cli guide to add a custom script in Janssen. The custom script has the following properties: Property Description key_store_file Keystore file path. Use these instructions to create a keystore. key_store_password Keystore file secret password providers_json_file Array of JSON Objects. Provider JSON file with social provider which you want to add for authentication. passport_fqdn Passport FQDN e.g. https://your-passport.com passport_token_endpoint_path It will use passport_fqdn as a prefix so just add path. e.g. /passport/token . Jans request this endpoint to get token for next auth request here . Check Step-1 in Setup Passport section to make token endpoint. passport_auth_endpoint_path It will use passport_fqdn as a prefix so just add path. e.g. /passport/auth . Jans request this endpoint to initiate auth request here . Check Step-2 in Setup Passport section to make passport auth endpoint. Jans will append provider and token during auth request e.g. If you have added google provider with id google in providers_json_file then jans request will be look like https://your-passport.com/passport/auth/google/<token> . Note: After adding and enabling successfully, you can check your Janssen's Auth Server OpenID Connect configuration by navigating to the following URL: https://your-jans-server.com/.well-known/openid-configuration. Find \"acr_values_supported\" and you should see passport-social . Note: Once you initiate auth request from your RP Application make sure to add acr_values=passport-social in the request. acr_values is your script name. Below is the providers_json_file format: [ { \"id\": \"google\", \"displayName\": \"google\", \"requestForEmail\": false, \"emailLinkingSafe\": false, \"logoImg\": \"img-url-or-path\" } ] Property Description id Unique string for your provider displayName This name will be shown on auth page logoImg This logo image will be shown on auth page e.g. /jans-auth/img/glu_icon.png requestForEmail It is not required to be true . If you set it to true then it will prompt a user to enter an email. emailLinkingSafe It is not required to be true . If you want to link to existing users then set it to true Customize login pages # Passport-social script uses passportlogin.xhtml and passportpostlogin.xhtml which are already comes which Janssen installation. No need to do anything. For UI Customization, you can download current page source code from here , modify UI, replace pages at path /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/pages/auth/passport/ and restart jans-auth server.

For this Inbound Jans Flow, You have to make a Passport Node JS project which help to generates auth request for your external social providers, get the user information, and send it to the Janssen server. Below things need to add in Passport JS Project to setup complete auth flow with Jans. Make a token endpoint which expose token with unique id. Jans will use this endpoint to get token and use this token for secur auth request. Passport Project has to validate this token in Jans request. This is just a simple strategy to protect passport endpoint from spam requests and only allow jans to request it. Code sample: // Encryption compatible with Jans EncryptionService // Salt File path: /etc/jans/conf/salt router . get ( '/token' , function ( req , res , next ) { const t = jwt . sign ( { jwt : uuidv4 () }, '<saltfilevalue>' , { expiresIn : 120 } // 2 min expiration ) res . status ( 200 ). send ({ token_ : t }) // key should be token_ } ) You need to use Salt File /etc/jans/conf/salt as a secret key. You will get this salt file after Jans intallation. Jans interception script uses this same file for decryption. Create auth request endpoints which will be request by User on Jans auth login page. For Example: Suppose you have added google strategy in your passport project. In that case you can make a endpoint like /google/:token . google is provider id in providers_json_file . token is the same token which we created in above step. After authentication Passport Project has to send encoded userinfo data to Jans https://<your.jans.server.com>/jans-auth/postlogin.htm . Below is the Node JS code sample to send POST request with data to Jans Post Login Endpoint. const postUrl = \"https://<your.jans.server.com>/jans-auth/postlogin.htm\" res . set ( 'content-type' , 'text/html;charset=UTF-8' ) return res . status ( 200 ). send ( ` <html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xml:lang=\"en\"> <body onload=\"document.forms[0].submit()\"> <noscript> <p> <b>Note:</b> your browser does not support JavaScript, please press the Continue button to proceed. </p> </noscript> <form action=\" ${ postUrl } \" method=\"post\"> <div> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"user\" value=\" ${ jwt } \"/> <noscript> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Continue\"/> </noscript> </div> </form> </body> </html>` ) Check next step to generate jwt . To make encoded userinfo data, use jwt private key signing technique. Check below sample code: // mapped user info data with ldap attributes const user = { uid : profile . username || profile . id , mail : profile . email , cn : profile . displayName , displayName : profile . displayName , givenName : profile . name . givenName , sn : profile . name . familyName , provider : \"<your-social-provider-name>\" , // e.g. google } jwt . sign ({ iss : 'https://<your.jans.server.com>/jans-auth/postlogin.htm' , sub : user . uid , aud : 'https://<your.jans.server.com>' , jti : uuidv4 (), exp : now / 1000 + 30 , iat : now , data : encrypt ( user ) }, privateKey , defaultRpOptions ) // Check `generate Keystore` section below to generate keys const privateKey = `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Your Private Key xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -----END PRIVATE KEY-----` cosnt defaultRpOptions = { algorithm : config . get ( 'keyAlg' ), header : { typ : 'JWT' , alg : config . get ( 'keyAlg' ), kid : config . get ( 'keyId' ) } } function encrypt ( obj ) { // Encryption compatible with Jans EncryptionService // Salt File path: /etc/jans/conf/salt const pt = JSON . stringify ( obj ) const encrypt = crypto . createCipheriv ( 'des-ede3-ecb' , '<saltfilevalue>' , '' ) let encrypted = encrypt . update ( pt , 'utf8' , 'base64' ) encrypted += encrypt . final ( 'base64' ) return encrypted } Follow Steps in Generate Keystore section to generate private key.

In the process of setting up a working environment, we will see how to use the command-line tool jans-cli to manually register an OpenID Connect client with the Janssen server. We will also see how to configure Relying Party to communicate with the Janssen server. Hardware configuration # For development and POC purposes, 4GB RAM and 10 GB HDD should be available for Janssen Server. For PROD deployments, please refer installation guide . Prerequisites # Installed Apache reverse proxy that is SSL enabled Installed Janssen server. Refer to Janssen Installation Guide for instructions. Component Setup # In this setup, we have four important components. - Protected resource is a resource that we need to protect using authentication. A web application for example. - User workstation is from where the user will use a browser(i.e user agent) to access the protected resource - Apache reverse proxy with mod_auth_openidc is our reverse proxy server and relying party. - Reverse Proxy : In our setup protected resources will be accessible through the proxy's FQDN https://test.apache.rp.io . For simplicity, we will use a CGI script as a protected resource and host it on the Apache proxy itself. In a typical production setup, protected resources are usually hosted on a separate server. - Relying Party : We will use Apache module mod_auth_openidc to provide relying party(RP) functionality. RP implements authentication flows from OpenID Connect specification. For each incoming request, RP ensures that the request is authenticated. If the request is not pre-authenticated, then RP will coordinate with Janssen server to integrate authentication. - Janssen server is our open-id connect provider (OP). We will assume that the Janssen server is accessible at FQDN https://janssen.op.io/ Configure Janssen server # In this section, we will register a new OpenID Connect client on Janssen server. In our setup, the relying party (Apache with mod_auth-openidc) is the OIDC client. There are two ways you can register OIDC client with Janssen server. 1. Manual Client Registration 2. Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) Here we will use manual client registration. To register a new OpenID connect client on the Janssen server, we will use jans-cli tool provided by the Janssen server. jans-cli has a menu-driven interface that makes it easy to configure the Janssen server. Here we will use the menu-driven approach to register a new client. To further understand how to use menu-driven approach and get complete list of supported command-line operations, refer to jans-cli documentation . Run the command below on Janssen server to enter interactive mode. Note: jans-cli has to be authenticated and authorized with the respective Janssen server. If jans-cli is being executed for the first time or if there is no valid access token available, then running the command below will initiate device authentication and authorization flow. In that case, follow the steps for jans-cli authorization to continue running the command. /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py Running above command will bring up main menu as shown in sample below: To register a new OpenID Connect client, select OAuth OpenID Connect - Clients option ( 16 in above sample). Selecting an appropriate option will bring up related sub-menu. From sub-menu, select option for Create new OpenId connect client . Upon selecting this option, CLI will prompt for inputs required to register a new OpenID connect client. Provide inputs for the following properties: displayName: <name-of-choice> application Type: web includeClaimsInIdToken [false]: Populate optional fields? y clientSecret: <secret-of-your-choice> subjectType: public tokenEndpointAuthMethod: client_secret_basic redirectUris: https://test.apache.rp.io/callback scopes: email_,openid_,profile responseTypes: code grantTypes: authorization_code Once values for all the above properties are provided, input c at the prompt to instruct jans-cli to create schema using inputs provided till now. At this time, jans-cli will show the schema(JSON) that will be used to create a new OpenID Connect client on Janssen server. Verify that schema has captured all the provided inputs correctly. Now next step is for jans-cli to post this JSON schema to Janssen server to actually register new client. To do this, input y on the prompt. If the client is successfully registered then we will receive JSON data back. This data describes newly registered client. Some of these values from this JSON response, like inum and clientSecret , will be required when we configure mod_auth_openidc as a client. So keep this reponse JSON handy. See a sample of JSON response below: { \"dn\": \"inum=165bdf95-f15e-44f0-bdd7-cdac71fda8e0,ou=clients,o=jans\", \"inum\": \"165bdf95-f15e-44f0-bdd7-cdac71fda8e0\", \"displayName\": \"dm\", \"clientSecret\": \"a9894ba8-eb01-4a26-a69d-026f10a49272\", \"frontChannelLogoutUri\": null, \"frontChannelLogoutSessionRequired\": false, \"registrationAccessToken\": null, \"clientIdIssuedAt\": null, \"clientSecretExpiresAt\": null, \"redirectUris\": null, \"claimRedirectUris\": null, \"responseTypes\": null, \"grantTypes\": [], \"applicationType\": \"web\", \"contacts\": null, \"clientName\": \"dm\", \"idTokenTokenBindingCnf\": null, \"logoUri\": null, \"clientUri\": null, \"policyUri\": null, \"tosUri\": null, \"jwksUri\": null, \"jwks\": null, \"sectorIdentifierUri\": null, \"subjectType\": \"public\", \"idTokenSignedResponseAlg\": null, \"idTokenEncryptedResponseAlg\": null, \"idTokenEncryptedResponseEnc\": null, \"userInfoSignedResponseAlg\": null, \"userInfoEncryptedResponseAlg\": null, \"userInfoEncryptedResponseEnc\": null, \"requestObjectSigningAlg\": null, \"requestObjectEncryptionAlg\": null, \"requestObjectEncryptionEnc\": null, \"tokenEndpointAuthMethod\": null, \"tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlg\": null, \"defaultMaxAge\": null, \"requireAuthTime\": false, \"defaultAcrValues\": null, \"initiateLoginUri\": null, \"postLogoutRedirectUris\": null, \"requestUris\": null, \"scopes\": null, \"claims\": null, \"trustedClient\": false, \"lastAccessTime\": null, \"lastLogonTime\": null, \"persistClientAuthorizations\": false, \"includeClaimsInIdToken\": false, \"refreshTokenLifetime\": null, \"accessTokenLifetime\": null, \"customAttributes\": [], \"customObjectClasses\": null, \"rptAsJwt\": false, \"accessTokenAsJwt\": false, \"accessTokenSigningAlg\": null, \"disabled\": false, \"authorizedOrigins\": null, \"softwareId\": null, \"softwareVersion\": null, \"softwareStatement\": null, \"attributes\": { \"tlsClientAuthSubjectDn\": null, \"runIntrospectionScriptBeforeAccessTokenAsJwtCreationAndIncludeClaims\": false, \"keepClientAuthorizationAfterExpiration\": false, \"allowSpontaneousScopes\": false, \"spontaneousScopes\": null, \"spontaneousScopeScriptDns\": null, \"backchannelLogoutUri\": null, \"backchannelLogoutSessionRequired\": false, \"additionalAudience\": null, \"postAuthnScripts\": null, \"consentGatheringScripts\": null, \"introspectionScripts\": null, \"rptClaimsScripts\": null }, \"backchannelTokenDeliveryMode\": null, \"backchannelClientNotificationEndpoint\": null, \"backchannelAuthenticationRequestSigningAlg\": null, \"backchannelUserCodeParameter\": null, \"expirationDate\": null, \"deletable\": false, \"jansId\": null } Configure protected resource # As mentioned under component setup , our protected resource will be hosted on Apache reverse proxy itself. It is a simple Python based cgi script that will print request header information and can be accessed through https://test.apache.rp.io/cgi-bin/printHeaders.py . Execute the steps below on Apache host to set up the protected resource: Create script file printHeaders.py vi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.py with content as below #!/usr/bin/python3 import os d = os.environ k = d.keys() print \"Content-type: text/html\\n\\n\" print \"<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>printHeaders.cgi</TITLE></Head><BODY>\" print \"<h1>Environment Variables</H1>\" for item in k: print \"<p><B>%s</B>: %s </p>\" % (item, d[item]) print \"</BODY></HTML>\" Add Apache cgi module to enable execution of CGI a2enmod cgi Change permissions for CGI script so that it can be executed by Apache chown www-data:www-data /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.py chmod ug+x /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.py At this point, printHeaders.py should be accessible at https://test.apache.rp.io/cgi-bin/printHeaders.py without requiring any authentication. Configure openidc module # Install mod-auth-openidc # On Apache reverse proxy host, add mod-auth-openidc using commands below apt-get install libapache2-mod-auth-openidc a2enmod auth_openidc service apache2 restart Configure mod-auth-openidc # Open /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf Add mod-auth-openidc configuration parameters given below for virtual host _default_:443 .

Upon valid authentication, Janssen will present the user with a consent screen where the user will be able to allow user attributes that can be provided to the app If allowed, the user will be successfully taken to the printHeaders.py page. In the process, mod_auth_openidc also requests user claims (i.e attributes) from the /userinfo endpoint of the Janssen server. And makes these claims available as environment variables to the application. printHeaders.py prints all the environment variables, along with user claims received from the Janssen server. The application can use this information to identify the user and also enforce access policies. Sample output below shows some of this user information and token information printed as part of environment variables: Environment Variables OIDC_CLAIM_sub: e205be81-6a85-4d83-9126 OIDC_CLAIM_email_verified: 1 OIDC_CLAIM_name: Default myname User OIDC_CLAIM_nickname: myname OIDC_CLAIM_given_name: myname OIDC_CLAIM_middle_name: myname OIDC_CLAIM_family_name: User OIDC_CLAIM_email: myname@mydomain.io OIDC_access_token: d6a12cce-f196-4da3-ba17 OIDC_access_token_expires: 165493257 HTTPS: on SSL_TLS_SNI: test.apache.rp.io","title":"Apache Reverse Proxy"},{"location":"admin/recipes/custom-web-development/authn-with-apache-reverse-proxy/#contents","text":"Overview Component Setup Configure Janssen server Configure Protected Resource Configure openidc module Test Complete Flow","title":"Contents:"},{"location":"admin/recipes/custom-web-development/authn-with-apache-reverse-proxy/#overview","text":"This guide describes steps to enable authentication for web applications using the Janssen server which is an OpenID Connect Provider (OP).

A web application for example. - User workstation is from where the user will use a browser(i.e user agent) to access the protected resource - Apache reverse proxy with mod_auth_openidc is our reverse proxy server and relying party. - Reverse Proxy : In our setup protected resources will be accessible through the proxy's FQDN https://test.apache.rp.io . For simplicity, we will use a CGI script as a protected resource and host it on the Apache proxy itself. In a typical production setup, protected resources are usually hosted on a separate server. - Relying Party : We will use Apache module mod_auth_openidc to provide relying party(RP) functionality. RP implements authentication flows from OpenID Connect specification. For each incoming request, RP ensures that the request is authenticated. If the request is not pre-authenticated, then RP will coordinate with Janssen server to integrate authentication. - Janssen server is our open-id connect provider (OP). We will assume that the Janssen server is accessible at FQDN https://janssen.op.io/","title":"Component Setup"},{"location":"admin/recipes/custom-web-development/authn-with-apache-reverse-proxy/#configure-janssen-server","text":"In this section, we will register a new OpenID Connect client on Janssen server. In our setup, the relying party (Apache with mod_auth-openidc) is the OIDC client. There are two ways you can register OIDC client with Janssen server. 1. Manual Client Registration 2. Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) Here we will use manual client registration. To register a new OpenID connect client on the Janssen server, we will use jans-cli tool provided by the Janssen server. jans-cli has a menu-driven interface that makes it easy to configure the Janssen server. Here we will use the menu-driven approach to register a new client. To further understand how to use menu-driven approach and get complete list of supported command-line operations, refer to jans-cli documentation . Run the command below on Janssen server to enter interactive mode. Note: jans-cli has to be authenticated and authorized with the respective Janssen server. If jans-cli is being executed for the first time or if there is no valid access token available, then running the command below will initiate device authentication and authorization flow. In that case, follow the steps for jans-cli authorization to continue running the command. /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py Running above command will bring up main menu as shown in sample below: To register a new OpenID Connect client, select OAuth OpenID Connect - Clients option ( 16 in above sample). Selecting an appropriate option will bring up related sub-menu. From sub-menu, select option for Create new OpenId connect client . Upon selecting this option, CLI will prompt for inputs required to register a new OpenID connect client. Provide inputs for the following properties: displayName: <name-of-choice> application Type: web includeClaimsInIdToken [false]: Populate optional fields? y clientSecret: <secret-of-your-choice> subjectType: public tokenEndpointAuthMethod: client_secret_basic redirectUris: https://test.apache.rp.io/callback scopes: email_,openid_,profile responseTypes: code grantTypes: authorization_code Once values for all the above properties are provided, input c at the prompt to instruct jans-cli to create schema using inputs provided till now. At this time, jans-cli will show the schema(JSON) that will be used to create a new OpenID Connect client on Janssen server. Verify that schema has captured all the provided inputs correctly. Now next step is for jans-cli to post this JSON schema to Janssen server to actually register new client. To do this, input y on the prompt. If the client is successfully registered then we will receive JSON data back. This data describes newly registered client. Some of these values from this JSON response, like inum and clientSecret , will be required when we configure mod_auth_openidc as a client. So keep this reponse JSON handy.

LF Projects, LLC (\u201cLF Projects\u201d) is a Delaware series limited liability company. All contributors (including committers, maintainers, and other technical positions) and other participants in the Project (collectively, \u201cCollaborators\u201d) must comply with the terms of this Charter. Mission and Scope of the Project The mission of the Project is to develop and maintain a cloud native identity and authorization platform that comprehensively implements OAuth, OpenID Connect and the User Managed Access protocol, while maintaining flexibility and horizontal scalability. The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project. Technical Steering Committee The Technical Steering Committee (the \u201cTSC\u201d) will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project. The TSC voting members are initially the Project\u2019s Committers. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the \u201cCONTRIBUTING\u201d file within the Project\u2019s code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person. TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Unless otherwise documented: Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project; Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (\u201ccommit\u201d) source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project\u2019s repository; and A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter. The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit. The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC. Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include: coordinating the technical direction of the Project; approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project\u2019s scope); organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects; creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements; appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities; establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies; approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the series manager of the Project (as provided for in the Series Agreement, the \u201cSeries Manager\u201d) to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter; discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project. TSC Voting While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis. Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting. Except as provided in Section 7.iii. and 8.i, decisions by vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met. Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote of all voting members of the TSC. In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the TSC, any voting member of the TSC may refer the matter to the Series Manager for assistance in reaching a resolution. Compliance with Policies This Charter is subject to the Series Agreement for the Project and the Operating Agreement of LF Projects. Contributors will comply with the policies of LF Projects as may be adopted and amended by LF Projects, including, without limitation the policies listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies/. The TSC may adopt a code of conduct (\u201cCoC\u201d) for the Project, which is subject to approval by the Series Manager. In the event that a Project-specific CoC has not been approved, the LF Projects Code of Conduct listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies will apply for all Collaborators in the Project. When amending or adopting any policy applicable to the Project, LF Projects will publish such policy, as to be amended or adopted, on its web site at least 30 days prior to such policy taking effect; provided, however, that in the case of any amendment of the Trademark Policy or Terms of Use of LF Projects, any such amendment is effective upon publication on LF Project\u2019s web site. All Collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted for all Collaborators by the TSC, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the Project community must not seek to exclude any participant based on any criteria, requirement, or reason other than those that are reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all Collaborators in the Project community. The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative, and ethical manner at all times. The output of all Project discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions, and status should be made open and easily visible to all. Any potential violations of this requirement should be reported immediately to the Series Manager. Community Assets LF Projects will hold title to all trade or service marks used by the Project (\u201cProject Trademarks\u201d), whether based on common law or registered rights. Project Trademarks will be transferred and assigned to LF Projects to hold on behalf of the Project. Any use of any Project Trademarks by Collaborators in the Project will be in accordance with the license from LF Projects and inure to the benefit of LF Projects. The Project will, as permitted and in accordance with such license from LF Projects, develop and own all Project GitHub and social media accounts, and domain name registrations created by the Project community. Under no circumstances will LF Projects be expected or required to undertake any action on behalf of the Project that is inconsistent with the tax-exempt status or purpose, as applicable, of LFP, Inc. or LF Projects, LLC. General Rules and Operations.

LF Projects, LLC (\u201cLF Projects\u201d) is a Delaware series limited liability company. All contributors (including committers, maintainers, and other technical positions) and other participants in the Project (collectively, \u201cCollaborators\u201d) must comply with the terms of this Charter. Mission and Scope of the Project The mission of the Project is to develop and maintain a cloud native identity and authorization platform that comprehensively implements OAuth, OpenID Connect and the User Managed Access protocol, while maintaining flexibility and horizontal scalability. The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project. Technical Steering Committee The Technical Steering Committee (the \u201cTSC\u201d) will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project. The TSC voting members are initially the Project\u2019s Committers. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the \u201cCONTRIBUTING\u201d file within the Project\u2019s code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person. TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Unless otherwise documented: Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project; Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (\u201ccommit\u201d) source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project\u2019s repository; and A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter. The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit. The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC. Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include: coordinating the technical direction of the Project; approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project\u2019s scope); organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects; creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements; appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities; establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies; approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the series manager of the Project (as provided for in the Series Agreement, the \u201cSeries Manager\u201d) to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter; discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project. TSC Voting While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis. Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting. Except as provided in Section 7.iii. and 8.i, decisions by vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met. Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote of all voting members of the TSC. In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the TSC, any voting member of the TSC may refer the matter to the Series Manager for assistance in reaching a resolution. Compliance with Policies This Charter is subject to the Series Agreement for the Project and the Operating Agreement of LF Projects. Contributors will comply with the policies of LF Projects as may be adopted and amended by LF Projects, including, without limitation the policies listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies/. The TSC may adopt a code of conduct (\u201cCoC\u201d) for the Project, which is subject to approval by the Series Manager. In the event that a Project-specific CoC has not been approved, the LF Projects Code of Conduct listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies will apply for all Collaborators in the Project. When amending or adopting any policy applicable to the Project, LF Projects will publish such policy, as to be amended or adopted, on its web site at least 30 days prior to such policy taking effect; provided, however, that in the case of any amendment of the Trademark Policy or Terms of Use of LF Projects, any such amendment is effective upon publication on LF Project\u2019s web site. All Collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted for all Collaborators by the TSC, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the Project community must not seek to exclude any participant based on any criteria, requirement, or reason other than those that are reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all Collaborators in the Project community. The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative, and ethical manner at all times. The output of all Project discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions, and status should be made open and easily visible to all. Any potential violations of this requirement should be reported immediately to the Series Manager. Community Assets LF Projects will hold title to all trade or service marks used by the Project (\u201cProject Trademarks\u201d), whether based on common law or registered rights. Project Trademarks will be transferred and assigned to LF Projects to hold on behalf of the Project. Any use of any Project Trademarks by Collaborators in the Project will be in accordance with the license from LF Projects and inure to the benefit of LF Projects. The Project will, as permitted and in accordance with such license from LF Projects, develop and own all Project GitHub and social media accounts, and domain name registrations created by the Project community. Under no circumstances will LF Projects be expected or required to undertake any action on behalf of the Project that is inconsistent with the tax-exempt status or purpose, as applicable, of LFP, Inc. or LF Projects, LLC. General Rules and Operations.

The copyrights are not assigned to the Janssen Project. Instead, they are licensed for distribution as part of the project. Whether a project uses a DCO or a CLA, the original copyright holders retain their copyrights. Copyright Notices # The Janssen Project does not require or recommend that every contributor include their copyright notice in contributed files. See below for more details on why not. Instead, we recommend using a more general statement in a form similar to the following: Copyright The Janssen Project Authors. Copyright The Janssen Project Contributors. Copyright Contributors to the Janssen Project. These statements are intended to communicate the following: - the work is copyrighted; - the contributors of the code licensed it, but retain ownership of their copyrights; and - it was licensed for distribution as part of the named project. By using a common format, the project avoids having to deal with names of copyright holders, years or ranges of years, and variations on the (c) symbol. This aims to minimize the burden on developers and maintainers as well as redistributors of the code. What if I want my copyright notice included? # Please note that it is not wrong , and it is acceptable, if a contributor wishes to keep their own copyright notices on their contributions. The above is a recommended format for ease of use, but is not mandated by the Janssen Project. If you are contributing on behalf of your employer, you may wish to discuss with your legal department about whether they will require you to include a copyright notice identifying them as the copyright holder in contributions. What about Third Party Code? # If a file only contains code that originates from a third party source who didn't contribute it themselves, then you would not want to add the notices above. (In a similar vein, you wouldn't add a notice identifying you as the copyright holder either, if you didn't own it.) Just preserve the existing copyright and license notices as they are.

Copyright notices are rarely kept up to date as a file evolves, resulting in inaccurate statements. Trying to keep notices up to date, or to correct notices that have become inaccurate, increases the burden on developers without tangible benefit. Developers and maintainers often do not want to have to worry about e.g. whether a minor contribution (such as a typo fix) means that a new copyright notice should be added.

Community holds triage calls at a regular cadence. Triage calls are mainly utilised to discuss issue/PR where concensus is not yet reached and to pick up anything which is not yet triaged.

Triaged All issues/PRs with label ready-for-triage will be reviewed by core members of the community who have permission to add triaged label. Reviewer reviews issue/PR to check if the issue/PR is fully triaged and can be added to backlog without discussion on triage call. At this point, label triaged is added and label ready-for-triage is removed. We expect most of the isseus and PRs will be able to follow above path and quickly move out of triage process without waiting for triage call.

In a typical setting users are shown a login form with a \"Sign in with...\" button for authentication to take place at a given 3rd party in order to get access to a target application. This process is usually referred to as \"inbound identity\". In this document the steps required to setup inbound identity in your Janssen server are presented. Requisites # A Janssen server with config-api installed Understanding of how to add and modify Agama flows in your server Starter knowledge of OAuth2 and the Java programming language Terminology # Provider: An external identity provider, often a social site. Every provider is associated with a unique identifier Provider preselection: A process that designates the provider to employ for authentication without the end-user making a explicit decision, i.e. without a \"Sign in with\" button. Here the provider may be inferred from contextual data elicited at earlier stages, for instance. Scope # There is a great amount of different mechanisms providers may employ to materialize the authentication process. The current offering in Agama is focused on OAuth2-compliant providers, more specifically those supporting the code authorization grant. This does not mean other grants or even different protocols such as SAML cannot be supported, however organizations would have to engage in extra development efforts in this case. If the providers of interest already support the code authorization grant, the amount of work is significantly reduced. Flows involved # Provider # For every provider to support there has to be an Agama flow that must: Redirect the browser to the provider's site for the user to enter his login credentials Return profile data of the given user Note the scope here is limited: no session is created in the Janssen server for the user - this occurs later in the main parent flow. To facilitate administrators' work, the following flows are already implemented: Apple Facebook Github Google Main flow # The actual process of inbound identity occurs here. This flow is already implemented and ready to use. The following is a summary of the steps involved: A provider selection page is displayed. The list includes all ( enabled ) providers defined in the configuration of this flow. Additionally an option to use an existing local account is displayed (i.e. no inbound identity) The flow associated to the selected provider is launched. Actually, if the main flow was passed a provider identifier as parameter, step 1 is skipped and the given flow is launched directly If the flow triggered at step 2 did not finish successfully, the main flow finishes likewise. Else, the profile data returned is transformed using the applicable attribute mapping for the provider. More on attribute mappings here If the resulting profile data lacks a value for e-mail, and the provider was configured to require it, a form is displayed where the user can enter his e-mail address User provisioning takes place, in other words, a local user entry is created in the Janssen server database. If an entry already exists, it is updated as long as the provider is configured to allow so The flow finishes successfully and the user gets access to the target application Note the above design does not involve communication protocols. It is responsability of the concrete provider flow how to implement this aspect. The main flow can remain unmodified regardless of any change in existing flows or when new ones are added. Feel free to modify this flow or create one based on it if customizations are required. Deployment # Add agama-inbound jar # To start, let's add the required libraries to the authentication server: Visit this page, navigate to the folder matching your Janssen server version, and download the file suffixed with jar-with-dependencies.jar SSH to the server. Transfer the file to directory /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/libs Navigate to /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/webapps and edit the file jans-auth.xml by adding <Set name=\"extraClasspath\">./custom/libs/*</Set> before the root tag closes Restart the server, e.g. systemctl restart jans-auth Add the basic authentication flow # The basic authentication flow is employed when no provider is picked from the list (step 1 here ) but the option to use an existing local account is taken. This flow is detailed in the Agama sample flows page , however those contents can be skipped for the purpose of this setup. Ensure Agama engine is enabled . Download the basic flow source file Use the API for adding flows as explained here and here . A sample curl command would look like this: curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' --data-binary @io.jans.flow.sample.basic https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/io.jans.flow.sample.basic - In the server, navigate to /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl . Create the folder hierarchy samples/basic there Download the login template to basic directory Add the main inbound flow # Download the flow source and add it as you did with the basic flow, ensure you use io.jans.inbound.ExternalSiteLogin this time In the server, navigate to /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama . Create folders named inboundID inside existing ftl and fl subdirectories Download the default logo and place it inside /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/fl/inboundID folder Download the provider selector template and place it inside /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl/inboundID folder. Note templates go under ftl , not fl . Do the same with the e-mail prompt template Add a provider flow # For simplicity, we'll illustrate here how to add one of the already implemented demo flows, namely, Facebook. Some guidelines on how to create a provider flow your own are given here . Download the utility flows . Add them to the server as you did with the main flow Download the Facebook flow code . Add it using the API as well Download the logo image and place it in /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/fl/inboundID Login to Facebook and register as developer. Create an application with Facebook login capabilities. In the Facebook login settings add https://<your-host>/jans-auth/fl/callback as a valid OAuth redirect URI. Finally grab the app Id and secret from the app settings page Set configuration parameters # Create a JSON file like the below. Replace data in the placeholders appropriately: [{ \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/metadata/properties\", \"value\": { \"authzEndpoint\": \"https://www.facebook.com/v14.0/dialog/oauth\", \"tokenEndpoint\": \"https://graph.facebook.com/v14.0/oauth/access_token\", \"userInfoEndpoint\": \"https://graph.facebook.com/v14.0/me\", \"clientId\": \"<APP-ID>\", \"clientSecret\": \"<APP-SECRET>\", \"scopes\": [\"email\", \"public_profile\"] } }] Patch the flow using the API. A sample curl command would look like this (assuming the JSON file is named fb.json ): curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json-patch+json' -X PATCH -d@fb.json https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/io.jans.inbound.Facebook Later, we'll dive into the meaning of the configuration parameters set in this JSON file. Parameterize the main flow # So far, if the main flow is launched (learn about this topic here ) a screen with an empty \"Sign in with\" list will be shown. Adding information about the known providers is required. Create a JSON file like the below: [{ \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/metadata/properties\", \"value\": { \"facebook\": { \"flowQname\": \"io.jans.inbound.Facebook\", \"displayName\": \"Facebook\", \"mappingClassField\": \"io.jans.inbound.Mappings.FACEBOOK\", \"logoImg\": \"facebook.png\" } } }] Patch the main flow using the API. A sample curl command would look like this (assuming the JSON file is named main.json ): curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json-patch+json' -X PATCH -d@main.json https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/io.jans.inbound.ExternalSiteLogin Later, we'll dive into the meaning of the configuration parameters set in this JSON file. Note : for limitations in the PATCH endpoint, do not use \"op\": \"add\" to add another provider. Use \"op\": \"replace\" and pass the whole JSON configuration (all providers) for value . Test # Launch the main flow (learn about this topic here ). If everything was setup correctly, a screen with a \"Sign in using\" heading will be shown and next to it a link titled \"Facebook\". When clicking on the link, the browser will be taken to the Facebook website for authentication. A prompt for consent of release of personal information may appear as well. Finally, the browser is taken back to your server and then to the target application as described here . Configuration parameters of flows # Main flow configurations # Configuration is supplied in a JSON object whose keys are the identifiers of the existing identity providers. The associated value for a key is a JSON object itself and follows the structure represented by this Java class. This is an example of a configuration for a couple of identity providers: { \"github\": { \"flowQname\": \"io.jans.inbound.Github\", \"displayName\": \"Github\", \"mappingClassField\": \"io.jans.inbound.Mappings.GITHUB\", }, \"google\": { \"flowQname\": \"io.jans.inbound.Google\", \"displayName\": \"Google\", \"mappingClassField\": \"io.jans.inbound.Mappings.GOOGLE\", \"enabled\": false, \"skipProfileUpdate\": true } } The table below explains the meaning of properties: Name Description Mandatory flowQname The qualified name of the Agama flow associated to this provider Yes displayName Short name of the provider (will be shown in the selector page) Yes mappingClassField The qualified name of the attribute mapping for this provider Yes logoImg Relative path to the logo image (will be shown in the selector page) No enabled A boolean value indicating whether this provider can be shown (and triggered) from the main flow or not. Default value is true No skipProfileUpdate Determines if profile data should not be updated for a user if an entry already exists locally for him. Default value is false No cumulativeUpdate When true , existing value(s) of an attribute are preserved when the incoming profile data already contains value(s) for such attribute, otherwise its values are replaced by the incoming ones entirely. Default value is false No requestForEmail Whether to prompt the user to enter his e-mail if the data supplied by the identity provider does not contain one. Default value is false No emailLinkingSafe Determines if an existing account with the same e-mail of the user about to be provisioned can be treated as the same person No Notes: logoImg path is relative to the base path of the main flow, i.e. inboundID Set emailLinkingSafe to true only if you trust the provider, i.e. the incoming e-mail data is securely verified. For security, never set it to true when requestForEmail is also true Provider flow configurations # Configurations for this kind of flows don't have to adhere to any specific structure. Developers are free to choose what fits best for their needs. Also note provider flows must not receive any inputs: the main flow won't pass any arguments when triggering them. Thus, design your flows so there is no use of Inputs but Configs directive in the header . In practice many identity providers adhere to the OAuth2 code grant, so you can re-use the structure represented by this Java class for the purpose. Particularly, the already implemented flows (like Facebook) use it for their configuration. The table below explains the meaning of its properties: Name Description authzEndpoint The authorization endpoint as in section 3.1 of RFC 7649 tokenEndpoint The token endpoint as in section 3.2 of RFC 7649 userInfoEndpoint The endpoint where profile data can be retrieved. This is not part of the OAuth2 specification clientId The identifier of the client to use, see section 1.1 and 2.2 of RFC 7649 . This client is assumed to be confidential as in section 2.1 clientSecret Secret associated to the client scopes A JSON array of strings that represent the scopes of the access tokens to retrieve redirectUri Redirect URI as in section 3.1.2 of RFC 7649 clientCredsInRequestBody true indicates the client authenticates at the token endpoint by including the credentials in the body of the request, otherwise, HTTP Basic authentication is assumed. See section 2.3.1 of RFC 7649 custParamsAuthReq A JSON object (keys and values expected to be strings) with extra parameters to pass to the authorization endpoint if desired custParamsTokenReq A JSON object (keys and values expected to be strings) with extra parameters to pass to the token endpoint if desired Here is an example: { \"authzEndpoint\": \"https://www.facebook.com/v14.0/dialog/oauth\", \"tokenEndpoint\": \"https://graph.facebook.com/v14.0/oauth/access_token\", \"userInfoEndpoint\": \"https://graph.facebook.com/v14.0/me\", \"clientId\": \"90210\", \"clientSecret\": \"changeit\", \"scopes\": [\"email\", \"public_profile\"] } Attribute mappings # This is the process through which the raw user profile data received by an identity provider is transformed into an object suitable for being stored in the Janssen's user database. Here, developers have the opportunity to \"map\" or \"transform\" the incoming data to one compatible with the data types, formats, and names required by the database. As an example suppose a provider returned the following: { \"id\": dfsg2-3bui2.2.5+ld1, \"email\": \"moe@doedoe.co\", \"last_name\": \"Doe\", \"first_name\": \"Moe\" } None of this attributes exist in Janssen, database adheres to LDAP naming. Conformant names would be uid , mail , sn , and givenName . Also, let's assume you want to set displayName to a string composed by the first and last names separated by a white space. Writing a mapping is required. A mapping is implemented in Java in the form of a java.util.function.UnaryOperator<Map<String, Object>> , that is, a function that takes a Map<String, Object> as input and returns a Map<String, Object> as result. Several examples are provided here . Note property mappingClassField of every provider defined in the main flow points to the fully qualified name of a mapping. Some important considerations: A mapping has to be declared as a public field in a public class Not all mappings have to belong to the same class Several providers can use the same mapping While working on a mapping, having to pack the class in a jar file, uploading it to the server, and then restarting every time a modification is made can be a big burden. To avoid this you can upload the source (java) file to the scripts directory of Agama and leverage hot reloading as outlined here . A \"template\" for quickly start writing a mapping is already available . Save with .java extension only, edit the body of the lambda expression, upload to the server, and then update the main flow as follows: Add an instruction like Call io.jans.inbound.CustomMappings#class at the beginning of the flow body for the class to be effectively reloaded when the file is modified Set mappingClassField to io.jans.inbound.CustomMappings.SAMPLE_MAPPING for the provider of interest. You may like the idea of using a different name for the field - update the java file accordingly From there onwards, you only need to re-upload the file as many times as needed. If you use DEBUG logging level in your server, you will see in the log the result of the mapping every time it is applied. Check for a message like \"Mapped profile is\". Utility flows # A couple of utility flows are available for developers writing flows: Qualified name Source code io.jans.inbound.oauth2.AuthzCode link io.jans.inbound.oauth2.AuthzCodeWithUserInfo link Authorization Code flow ( io.jans.inbound.oauth2.AuthzCode ): This flow implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant where client authentication at the token endpoint occurs as described in section 2.3.1 of RFC 6749 (HTTP basic authentication scheme). In summary, this flow redirects the browser to the external provider's site where the user will enter his credentials, then back at the Janssen redirect URL a code is obtained which is employed to issue an access token request. The flow returns the token response as received by the provider Authorization Code flow with userInfo request ( io.jans.inbound.oauth2.AuthzCodeWithUserInfo ): This flow reuses the previous flow and additionally issues a request to a given userInfo URL passing the access token in the HTTP Authorization header. The response obtained (the profile data of the user) is returned in conjuction with the token response of the authorization code flow The above means that often, when writing a new flow for a provider, the task boils down to calling the latter flow and returning profile data only. Creating a provider flow # A provider flow must fulfil the conditions as summarized earlier . Developers have to figure out if the OAuth2 code authorization grant is supported, where the task is simplified to get the required configurations . Here, the source code flow of a flow like Facebook can be re-used - probably without modification other than in the header.","title":"Agama Inbound Identity"},{"location":"script-catalog/agama/inboundID/#inbound-identity-with-agama","text":"Using Agama administrators can delegate authorization to external services like social sites.

They are by their very nature, unguessable strings that meet the prescribed OAuth security guidelines for lack of order or predictability (entropy). However, there is still a large amount of data that may be attached to a token, such as:- - its current validity, - approved scopes, - information about the context in which the token was issued. Access token data is essential for the resource server to evaluate policies that determine whether or not to allow the request. Token introspection therefore enables a client to trade an OAuth reference token for its JSON equivalent by making a request per OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection Guide - (RFC 7662) . The use of Introspection scripts allows the ability to modify the response of Introspection Endpoint spec and provide additional information in the JSON response. Interface # In order to be run and Introspection script should be associated with an OpenID Client (used for obtaining the token).

WWPass employs strong cryptography and robust combination of authentication factors to deliver a secure and user-friendly authentication experience. WWPass authentication starts with a smartphone app or a hardware token as the first authentication factor. Then additional authentication factors such as PIN or biometrics can be added to verify the user identity further. Gluu Server is a container distribution of free open source software (FOSS) for identity and access management (IAM). Gluu Server combines SAML 2.0, LDAP, OpenID Connect, and other authentication and authorization protocol implementations to create a platform for user authentication, identity information, and policy decisions. Combining WWPass strong multi-factor authentication with the versatility of Gluu Server helps to build secure IAM solutions that can be used for single sign-on (SSO), customer identity and access management (CIAM), and identity federation. Prerequisites # This tutorial assumes that you have the following: Gluu Server 4.1.1 installed on Ubuntu Server 18.04 or 16.04; An administrative account on this Ubuntu Server; An application certificate and private key for WWPass authentication; WWPass Key app or hardware token; Obtain Application Certificate and Private Key From WWPass # To obtain an application certificate and private key go to wwpass.com , click Sign Up to create a developer account or Log In if you already have an account. Then follow the website instructions to register your application domain and issue the application certificate. Prepare WWPass Integration Files # Copy this directory to your Gluu server and make it current cd wwpass Files in pages directory should be deployed to /opt/gluu-server/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/custom/pages/ sudo cp -rL pages/* /opt/gluu-server/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/custom/pages/ Files in static directory should be deployed to /opt/gluu-server/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/custom/static/ sudo cp -rL pages/* /opt/gluu-server/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/custom/static/ Copy wwpass.py to /opt/gluu-server/opt/gluu/python/libs/ sudo cp wwpass.py /opt/gluu-server/opt/gluu/python/libs/ Copy ticket.json to /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/cgi sudo mkdir -p /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/cgi sudo cp ticket.json /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/cgi Make sure ticket.json is executable sudo chmod 755 /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/cgi/ticket.json Copy WWPass application certificate and private key to /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/ (assuming the certificate and key files are in your home directory) sudo cp ~/gluu_client.crt /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/gluu_client.crt sudo cp ~/gluu_client.key /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/gluu_client.key Replace ~/gluu_client.crt and ~/gluu_client.key with the names and location of your certificate and key files. Copy WWPass CA certificate wwpass.ca.crt to /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/ sudo cp wwpass.ca.crt /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu Log in to the Gluu Server container sudo /sbin/gluu-serverd login Change ownership of files and directories just copied chown -R jetty:jetty /opt/jetty chown root:gluu /opt/gluu/python/libs/wwpass.py Configure Apache # Use your favorite console text editor to change Apache configuration [vi|nano|joe|...] /opt/gluu-server/etc/apache2/sites-available/https_gluu.conf Scroll down the file until you find the last <Location>...</Location> tag and insert the following snippet below it: <Location /wwpass > require all granted </Location> ScriptAlias \"/wwpass/\" \"/opt/wwpass_gluu/cgi/\" <Directory /opt/wwpass_gluu/cgi/ > SetHandler cgi-script Options +ExecCGI Order deny,allow Allow from all </Directory> Save the file and exit the editor. Enable mod_cgi and restart apache: a2enmod cgi systemctl restart apache2 Check that ticket.json is working. Go to https://<your_gluu_host>/wwpass/ticket.json . If your setup is correct, you will see output like this: { \"result\" : true , \"data\" : \"SPNAME:07629a1963c5e4f4f339ecb852b7a0bf10a90c62@p-sp-05-50:16033\" , \"ttl\" : 600 , \"encoding\" : \"plain\" } Configure Gluu Server # Log in as administrator and go to \"Configuration -> Manage Custom scripts\". In Person Authentication tab, click Add custom script configuration at the bottom of the page Create custom script wwpass with Location Type set to Database . Add the following to Custom Property fields by clicking on Add new property button: wwpass_crt_file: /opt/wwpass_gluu/gluu_client.crt wwpass_key_file: /opt/wwpass_gluu/gluu_client.key registration_url: URL of the registration web application, if you have one. Do not add this property otherwise recovery_url: URL for account recovery, if you have one. Do not add this property otherwise. To require PIN or biometrics during login, add: use_pin: True To enable binding WWPass keys with email, add: allow_email_bind: True Note, your Gluu server should be able to send emails, see Configuration -> Organization configuration -> SMTP Server Configuration . To enable binding WWPass keys with existing usernames and passwords, add: allow_password_bind: True To enable binding WWPass keys with another WWPass key, add: allow_passkey_bind: True Replace the content of Script textbox with the content of wwpassauth.py from gluu-master Set Enabled checkbox to enable the custom script: Click the Update button. It's also recommended to increase the unauthenticated session lifetime to give users more time to bind their WWPass keys. Go to Configuration -> JSON configuration -> OxAuth Configuration , find sessionIdUnauthenticatedUnusedLifetime setting and set it to 600 or more. Click Update to save settings. Set up Authentication Method # Before switching to WWPass authentication, make sure you have opened an administrator session in a different browser (not in a different window, but a completely different browser). Do not close that browser window and reload it from time to time to make sure your session does not expire. Keep the backup session opened until you are sure that WWPass authentication works properly or you might lock yourself out of Gluu. If that happens, refer to: Gluu FAQ In the Gluu Admin interface, navigate to Configuration -> Manage Authentication -> Default Authentication Method . Set both options to \"wwpass\". Click Update to save settings. Test Your Setup # Open \"https:// /\" in a different browser (not the one you used to configure Gluu).

WWPass employs strong cryptography and robust combination of authentication factors to deliver a secure and user-friendly authentication experience. WWPass authentication starts with a smartphone app or a hardware token as the first authentication factor. Then additional authentication factors such as PIN or biometrics can be added to verify the user identity further. Gluu Server is a container distribution of free open source software (FOSS) for identity and access management (IAM). Gluu Server combines SAML 2.0, LDAP, OpenID Connect, and other authentication and authorization protocol implementations to create a platform for user authentication, identity information, and policy decisions. Combining WWPass strong multi-factor authentication with the versatility of Gluu Server helps to build secure IAM solutions that can be used for single sign-on (SSO), customer identity and access management (CIAM), and identity federation.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"script-catalog/person_authentication/other/wwpass/#prerequisites","text":"This tutorial assumes that you have the following: Gluu Server 4.1.1 installed on Ubuntu Server 18.04 or 16.04; An administrative account on this Ubuntu Server; An application certificate and private key for WWPass authentication; WWPass Key app or hardware token;","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"script-catalog/person_authentication/other/wwpass/#obtain-application-certificate-and-private-key-from-wwpass","text":"To obtain an application certificate and private key go to wwpass.com , click Sign Up to create a developer account or Log In if you already have an account.
