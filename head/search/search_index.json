Developer Guide # There are many ways the community can contribute to the Janssen Project. Of course, you can contribute code. But we also need people to write documentation and guides, to help us with testing, to answer questions on the forums and chat, to review PRs, to help us with devops and CI/CD, to provide feedback on usability, and to promote the project through outreach. Also, by sharing metrics with us, we can gain valuable insights into how the software performs in the wild. Resources to get started are available here . Governance Guide # The Janssen Project is an open source member of the Linux Foundation. Information about the project's governance can be found here . Script Catalog # Interception scripts (or custom scripts) allow you to define custom business logic for various features offered by the OpenID Provider (Jans-auth server). Some examples of features which can be customized are - implementing a 2FA authentication method, consent gathering, client registration, adding business specific claims to ID token or Access token etc. Scripts can easily be upgraded and doesn't require forking the Jans Server code or re-building it. The definitive location for scripts and their documentation is the Script Catalog . Agama # Agama is a component of the Janssen authentication server that offers an alternative way to build web-based authentication flows. Typically, person authentication flows are defined in the server by means of jython scripts that adhere to a predefined API. With Agama, flows are coded using a DSL (domain specific language) designed for the sole purpose of writing web flows. Support # We prefer to have all our discussions through GitHub Discussions to better facilitate faster responses. However, other means are available such as the community chat on Gitter . You can register for free there with your Github identity. If you find a bug in a Janssen project, or you would like to suggest a new feature, try the GitHub Discussions first.

environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. Our Standards # Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include: Using welcoming and inclusive language Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences Gracefully accepting constructive criticism Focusing on what is best for the community Showing empathy towards other community members Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include: The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks Public or private harassment Publishing others\u2019 private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Our Responsibilities # Janssen Project members, project participants and contributors (collectively, \"participants\") are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. The Technical Steering Committee (\"TSC\") of the Janssen Project has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any participant for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. All participants have determined that The Linux Foundation is the most optimal organization to shepherd the development of this project. Participants acknowledge and agree to The Linux Foundation's exclusive right to use \"Janssen Project\" and any other names and trademarks associated with the open source project and Janssen Project and to authorize others\u2019 use of the marks, establish guidelines for such use, and to delegate these responsibilities.

Participants will not independently adopt, use, or attempt to register any trademarks or trade names that are confusingly similar to these names. Scope # This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers. Enforcement # Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Executive Director, or, if the complaint involves the Executive Director, a member of the steering committee. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

If you need Janssen installation to test out your fix, here are the steps . Contribution Guidelines # We are really glad you are reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition. Code of Conduct Issues Triaging Coding Conventions Code of Conduct # Janssen project has a Code of Conduct to which all contributors must adhere, please read it before interacting with the repository or the community in any way. About Issues # There are four kinds of issues you can open: Bug report : you believe you found a problem in a project and you want to discuss and get it fixed, creating an issue with the bug report template is the best way to do so. Feature Request : any kind of new feature need to be discussed in this kind of issue, do you want a new rule or a new feature? This is the kind of issue you want to open. Be very good at explaining your intent, it's always important that others can understand what you mean in order to discuss, be open and collaborative in letting others help you getting this done! Security Vulnerability : If you identify a security problem, please report it immediately, providing details about the nature, and if applicable, how to reproduce it. If you want to report an issue privately, you can email security@gluu.org Failing tests : you noticed a flaky test or a problem with a build? This is the kind of issue to triage that! The best way to get involved in the project is through issues, you can help in many ways: Issues triaging: participating in the discussion and adding details to open issues is always a good thing, sometimes issues need to be verified, you could be the one writing a test case to fix a bug! Fix an issue: you can help in getting issue fixed in many ways. More often by opening a pull request. In case you are first-time contributor, then you can start with our good first issues list These are issues where you can easily contribute and community members will guide and support your contribution as always. Triaging # Triage is a process of evaluating issues and PRs in order to determine their characteristics and take quick actions if possible. When you triage an issue, you: assess whether it has merit or not quickly close it by correctly answering a question point the reporter to a resource or documentation answering the issue tag it via labels, projects, or milestones take ownership submitting a PR for it, in case you want \ud83d\ude07 Here is how we continously triage new issues and PRs so that contributors can contribute faster and better. Code Conventions and Guidelines # Commits # Janssen Project mandates all commits to follow guidelines as below. Commit messages As commit convention, we adopt Conventional Commits v1.0.0 , we have an history of commits that do not adopt the convention but any new commit must follow it to be eligible for merge. Add GPG signature to your commit To ensure that contribution is coming for a trusted source, all commits should be signed using GPG key and verified by Github. If you have GPG key setup already then just use -S switch with you commit to sign it. If you need to setup your GPG key and verification, then you can find detailed instructions here Add DCO sign-off The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Contributors to the Janssen project sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages. This is a commit message Signed-off-by: Foo Bar <foobar@spam.org> Git even has a -s command line option to append this automatically to your commit message: $ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message' In all, if you have your GPG verification setup, your commit command should look like git commit -S -s -m 'message that follows conventional commit style' Branches # Branch name should have component name as prefix, eg jans-core-mybranch PRs # PR titles should also follow Conventional Commits v1.0.0 . This will help in keeping merge commit messages inline with commit message standards Squash commits into small number of cohesive commits before raising a PR PR should be rebased on main branch so that there are minimal or no conflicts at the time of merge PR should only have changes related to target feature or issue. Create a separate PR for formatting or other quick bug fixes PR should include relevent documentaton changes PR should include unit and integration tests Issues # Issue titles should follow Conventional Commits v1.0.0 Backport changes to a different version # Backport changes are now supported through a workflow through labels prefixed with backport/ . For-example to backport changes in a certain PR to version v1.0.0 a label to that PR matching the version must be added i.e backport/v1.0.0 . The flow consists of creating a new branch, cherry-picking the changes of the original PR and creating a new PR to merge them. Contributing to the documentation # Great documentation is a reflection of software's maturity and the great community that stands behind it. Contributing to the Janssen Project documentation is the easiest way to learn about the Janssen Project and to get involved in the community process. In order to ensure consistency of style, language, format, and terminology across all documents, please follow the guidelines below: Glossary of terms # This glossary helps to keep terms and their meanings consistent across documentation. Janssen Project or Jans : Refers to the official project name under Linux Foundation that seeks to build the world\u2019s fastest and most comprehensive cloud native identity and access management software platform Janssen Server : Refers to a set of software components developed under the Janssen Project . Components of the Janssen Server include client and server implementations of the OAuth, OpenID Connect, SCIM and FIDO standards. The term Janssen Server is used to refer to these components as a group. jans-auth-server : Refers to a module within the Janssen Server named jans-auth-server . This is one of the significant modules of the Janssen Server that has an implementation for OAuth and OpenId Connect. Janssen Server module names: For correct naming of other modules of the Janssen Server, please refer to README Documentation Style Guide # Janssen Project documentation uses Markdown. Guidelines below are intended to bring consistency in writing and formatting documents. Testing Janssen Project documentation site is published using MkDocs. Markdown parsers used by Github and the one used by MkDocs may have slight variations in how they generate HTML. So, for a small number of cases, document may look different between Github and Janssen Project documentation site . Hence it is critical to test documentation changes locally before pushing to repository. This will ensure that final HTML rendering of documents by MkDocs is as desired. Document Title # The document title summarises what the document aims to achieve and at the same time, it plays a critical role in making the document easy to find via search. Below are a few guidelines to write good titles for documents. Every document must start with a title. Meaning, #<space><title text> Title should summarise what the document is trying to achieve. For examples: Integrating with the Apache mod_auth_openidc module , Integrating DUO's Universal Prompt as an authentication method , Install using Ubuntu Linux Package Title should include its context. For example, the document under Installation > VM Installation > Ubuntu should not be titled as just Ubuntu but it should have a more detailed title similar to Install using Ubuntu Linux Package . When required, to keep the title from becoming too long, assume that Janssen Server is already understood as context. Titles should be written using title case Document Tags # Janssen Project documentation uses tags to make the search more accurate and add context to search results. Following are guidelines and examples to follow while adding tags to a document. Maximum 6 tags First three should establish the context of the section hierarchy under which the document belongs. See the example below. Remaining tags can be based on the content of the document. Each tag should be a single word (no spaces, hyphens or commas, etc) All tags should be in lowercase Example: Let's look at how to add tags to a document that is located on documentation site at path Administration -> Installation -> VM installation . Also, assume that the document describes the steps to install Janssen Project on the Ubuntu platform. Tags below would be recommended: --- ta gs : - admi n is trat io n - i nstallat io n - vm - ubu ntu --- Referencing Janssen Project Release in Documents # When a reference to the current release is required in the documentation content, use the text replace-janssen-version instead of mentioning the current release number. Janssen Project build system will replace replace-janssen-version text with the current release number at the time of every release. i.e. at the time of releasing documentation for the Janssen Project release of v1.0.5, all occurrences of replace-janssen-version will be replaced by v1.0.5 . For example, below is the URL used in the documentation to point to the specification of API for corresponding Janssen Project release. It is important that this link points to corresponding specification of that release. https://gluu.org/swagger-ui/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/replace-janssen-version/jans-auth-server/docs/swagger.yaml In every new release of Janssen Project (and corresponding Janssen documentation) only the replace-janssen-version part of the URL changes. So, at the time of releasing the documentation for v1.0.4 , the build system will update the replace-janssen-version in the URL so the URL becomes https://gluu.org/swagger-ui/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/v1.0.4/jans-auth-server/docs/swagger.yaml At the time of releasing v1.0.5 , the build system will update the same URL as below https://gluu.org/swagger-ui/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/v1.0.5/jans-auth-server/docs/swagger.yaml This way, URL always points to the specification in corresponding release without updating it manually everytime before release. General Text # Allow long lines to wrap, rather than manually breaking them. For example, the Introduction paragraph is a single line Keep explanations short and clear Use complete sentences when possible To make text italicised , put an _ on each side, like this: _word_ To bold text, put a double * on each end, like this: **word** Leave a blank line between paragraphs. Count a header as a paragraph for this purpose Avoid passive voice as much as possible. It's clearer to say that a subject does something than to say a result was done Avoid using you in statements as much as possible. For example, instead of saying You can navigate to... simply say Navigate to... Page Setup # Start your page with a title on the first line Follow with a concise overview of the document / product's purpose Organize the information in the document from least technical to most technical if possible. Start conceptual, then get detailed Lists # Leave a blank line between text and first item in the list Only use a numbered list if the order of the list matters A line of a list should not end with a period. If it's multiple sentences, like this one, drop the last period Start each item in the list with a capital letter End each item in the list with at least three spaces. This makes sure the line breaks properly To make a bulleted list, start each line with - To make a numbered list, start each line with 1. For example: 1. This is the first item 1. This is the second item 1. This is the third item It will look like this: 1. This is the first item 2. This is the second item 3. This is the third item To include additional lines in a list item, start the sub-line with four spaces. For example: 1. This is the first item in a list There are four spaces to start this line Another four spaces here This keeps all text inside the numbered list item, before starting... 1. The following list item It will look like this: This is the first item in a list There are four spaces to start this line Another four spaces here This keeps all text inside the list, before starting... The following list item Other formatting considerations # Admonitions cannot be nested inside a list. They must be aligned all the way left. Inserting them within a list will break the list sequence (starting back over from 1). Nesting a fenced block of code in a numbered list is more challenging, as the list and code block syntaxes clash. To nest a code block into a list, insert four spaces to the left of all lines of the formatting. For example: 1. This is the first item ``` This is code This is also code. ``` 1. This is the second item It will look like this: This is the first item This is code This is also code. This is the second item Headings # Headings should be in title format. All important words should be capitalized The main title of the page should start with a single # , then each level of subheading should add one. For example, the first subheading should start with ## , a subheading of that should use ### , and so on Code Formatting # To format text as code within a line of normal text, surround the code with a single backtick (`). If the code is to be on its own line, it should be a fenced code block. To make a fenced code block, make a line before and after the code with three backticks: ``` This is code ``` We use the SuperFences plugin to enhance this functionality. Examples & Navigation # When possible, provide an example in the form of code output or a screenshot To instruct a user to click a button, or navigate to a certain page or through a menu, use the following style: Navigate to `Configuration` > `Authentication` and click the `Passport` tab It will look like this: Navigate to Configuration > Authentication and click the Passport tab Linking # We recommend using relative linking syntax when linking to other artifacts in repository. Linking to a page within the same repo use this format: [text for the link](../where/the/link/goes.md) - You must link to the .md file on GitHub for it to work properly - As an example, to make text this link link to a Markdown document named example.md in the same directory, you'd type it as [this link](./example.md) Service Commands # The Janssen Server supports many different Operating Systems (e.g. Ubuntu, SUSE etc.). Service commands can vary. Rather than \"hard coding\" service commands into documentation, please instead reference the dedicated documentation page for Service Commands . In documenting a process that involves a service restart, the Service Command documentation is linked: ## Add the attribute to LDAP - Add custom attribute - [Restart](https://jans.io/docs/vm-ops/restarting-services/) the `jans-auth.service` service. The word Restart is simply linked to the dedicated doc for Service Commands. Tables # Try to make tables visually readable by spacing to make distinct columns The header for each column must be separated by at least three dashes Use outer pipes for consistency If an entry is too long to fit in the neat boxes, that's fine, just try to keep it legible An example table follows: |This |Is |A |Table | |--------|-------|------|---------| |1 |2 |3 |4 | |Word |Code |Text |Table | It looks like this: This Is A Table 1 2 3 4 Word Code Text Table Help On Technical Writing # It is essential for everyone in the community to actively participate in the documentation. At the same time, not everyone is formally trained or experienced in writing technical documents. To help everyone understand the basics of good technical writing, we have listed a few resources below. Going through these resources will not take a lot of time and will help in writing better technical documents. Introduction to Technical Writing (part-1) Introduction to Technical Writing (part-2) Contribution Workflow # Find something to work on # Best place to find something to work on is to look at currently open issues . If you are a first time contributor then starting with list of good first issues is best. Start a discussion # Start a Github Discussion about what you are planning to contribute. Explain the feature or issue that you are planning to contribute and what your solution or implementation approach. Janssen is a community driven project and it'll be helpful to get community's view about it. Create an issue # Take your time to write a proper issue including a good summary and description. Outcome of Github discussion about your contribution can help you create good content for the issue. As a first step when creating a new issue, an issue template has to be selected. Select appropriate issue template and it'll help you create an issue with right content. Remember that issue may be the first thing a reviewer of your PR will look at to get an idea of what you are proposing. It will also be used by the community in the future to find about what new features and enhancements are included in new releases. Implement the change # All contributions to Janssen Project should be made via Github pull requests(PR). New to PR workflow?? Learn and practice it at first-contributions Create a Fork # Fork Janssen repository . And create a clone. Implement the Change # Start working on changes as required. Make sure the code conventions are being followed. Use static code analysis and linting tools to make sure the code is high-quality. Write tests first and then code. Ensure that integration tests that cover your code are appropriately updated and reviewed. Create PR early and push often. Janssen uses Github actions to run automated checks on PR changes. Ensure that these checks are passing with every push. Engage PR reviewers at the start so that they can continue to reivew code as it is developed and in small chunks. For a change that is non-trivial(an enhancement or a new feature), design should be reviewed. This should be done via PR by adding appropriate code owners. Document # PR should include changes in relevant documentation along with code changes. PR is checked by bot to have either one of the following : A commit that follows commit guidelines with docs: message Changes in artifacts under jans/docs If PR does not need any documentation changes, then the developer needs to acknowledge that in one of two ways: Add an empty commit to the PR (using --allow-empty git flag) with docs: message (i.e docs: no doc changes required ) Add footer to the commit message of one of the code commits with docs: message e.g fix: typo on class name More details here. docs: no docs modification Raise a PR # Make sure that PR title follows these guidelines Janssen uses Github PR template. Template provides helpful instructions to ensure new PRs are complete in details and easy to review. Github will populate new PR's description with these instructions. You can edit PR description as per your requirements. When PR is raised, Github will automatically assign reviewer to the PR based changed files and CODEOWNERS list. Once PR is raised, ensure that PR passes all the mandatory Github actions checks available on Github PR page. Github will not allow PR to be merged if any of the mandatory check is failing. Follow Through # Once the PR is raised, wait for reviewers to start review. Reviewers will start review at the first opportunity available. If you want to draw attention, give a gentle reminder in PR comments. But please be patient. Follow activities on your PR closely till the time PR is merged. PR reviewer may want to suggest a change or may need to ask a question to get more clarity. Make sure you are actively collaborating. Once Reviewer has completed the review and approved the changes, the PR will be merged. Thats it!!

Janssen Project build system will replace replace-janssen-version text with the current release number at the time of every release. i.e. at the time of releasing documentation for the Janssen Project release of v1.0.5, all occurrences of replace-janssen-version will be replaced by v1.0.5 . For example, below is the URL used in the documentation to point to the specification of API for corresponding Janssen Project release. It is important that this link points to corresponding specification of that release. https://gluu.org/swagger-ui/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/replace-janssen-version/jans-auth-server/docs/swagger.yaml In every new release of Janssen Project (and corresponding Janssen documentation) only the replace-janssen-version part of the URL changes. So, at the time of releasing the documentation for v1.0.4 , the build system will update the replace-janssen-version in the URL so the URL becomes https://gluu.org/swagger-ui/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/v1.0.4/jans-auth-server/docs/swagger.yaml At the time of releasing v1.0.5 , the build system will update the same URL as below https://gluu.org/swagger-ui/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/v1.0.5/jans-auth-server/docs/swagger.yaml This way, URL always points to the specification in corresponding release without updating it manually everytime before release.","title":"Referencing Janssen Project Release in Documents"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#general-text","text":"Allow long lines to wrap, rather than manually breaking them.

If other algorithms are necessary, Janssen supports them via interception scripts. When the connection between a device (such as a client) and a server is established, the client and the server exchange data in order to determine the algorithms to use in the transport layer. To know more browse here The following are the type of keys Signing Encryption Hashing Signing Keys # Signing or Signature algorithm is a cryptographic mechanism used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital data. We may consider it as a digital version of the ordinary handwritten signatures, but with higher levels of complexity and security.

A client uses authorization endpoint to obtain an authorization grant. Based on response type requested by the client, the authorization endpoint issues an authorization code or an access token. Authorization endpoint is a protected endpoint which will require end-user authentication before issuing authorization code or access token. URL to access authorization endpoint on Janssen Server is listed in the response of Janssen Server's well-known configuration endpoint given below. https://janssen.server.host/jans-auth/.well-known/openid-configuration authorization_endpoint claim in the response specifies the URL for authorization endpoint. By default, authorization endpoint looks like below: https://janssen.server.host/jans-auth/restv1/authorize More information about request and response of the authorization endpoint can be found in the OpenAPI specification of jans-auth-server module . Disabling The Endpoint Using Feature Flag # TODO: It seems this endpoint can't be disabled using featureflags. Confirm this. Configuration Properties # Authorization endpoint can be further configured using Janssen Server configuration properties listed below. When using Janssen Text-based UI(TUI) to configure the properties, navigate via Auth Server -> Properties . issuer requirePkce fapiCompatibility forceSignedRequestObject authorizationCodeLifetime returnDeviceSecretFromAuthzEndpoint requestUriBlockList requireRequestObjectEncryption staticDecryptionKid requestUriHashVerificationEnabled legacyIdTokenClaims customHeadersWithAuthorizationResponse includeSidInResponse sessionIdRequestParameterEnabled returnDeviceSecretFromAuthzEndpoint requirePar cibaMaxExpirationTimeAllowedSec Required Client Configuration # Clients must be registered with Janssen Server as using code and/or implicit grant types in order to use authorization endpoint. Using Janssen Text-based UI(TUI) , client can be registered for appropriate grant type by navigating to Auth-Server -> Clients -> Add Client Using PKCE # Janssen Server supports PKCE , which recommended and more secure method for using code grant. PKCE can be enabled/disable by setting requirePkce property. Janssen server supports plain as well as s256 code challenge methods. Using PAR # As a separate endpoint, Janssen Server supports PAR (Pushed Authorization Requests) to enable authorization using more complex authorization requests and making it more secure at the same time. Use Janssen Server configuration property requirePar to accept only PAR requests. Using JARM # Authorization endpoint supports JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode, or JARM . Using JARM makes authorization responses more secure and compliant to be used in FAPI deployments. Janssen Server supports all response modes as defined in JARM specification Using Prompt Parameter # prompt request parameter is an ASCII string value that specifies whether the Authorization Server prompts the End-User for re-authentication and consent. Janssen Server supports none , login , consent and select_account values for prompt parameter. Multiple values can be specified by separating them with single space. Based on value/s of this request parameter Authorization Server prompts the End-User for re-authentication and consent. none # none value will instruct Janssen Server NOT to display any authentication or consent user interface pages. An error is returned if the End-User is not already authenticated or the Client does not have pre-configured consent for the requested scopes. This can be used as a method to check for existing authentication and/or consent. login # login value will instruct Janssen Server to prompt the End-User for re-authentication. consent # consent value will instruct Janssen Server to prompt the End-User for consent before returning information to the Client. select_account # select_account value will instruct Janssen Server to prompt the End-User to select a user account. This allows a user who has multiple accounts at the Authorization Server to select amongst the multiple accounts that they may have current sessions for. Configuring Authentication Methods # acr_values request parameter is used to specify authentication methods to be used by Janssen Server to authenticate the end user. Multiple acr values can be specified by separating them with a space. In order to use a particular acr value, the client needs to be authorized to use all the acr values in the list. If no the request doesn't specify any acr value then the default acr value configured for respective client is used by Janssen server for end user authentication. Customizing using Interception Scripts # Interception scripts allows flexibility to configure and customize multiple aspects in Janssen Server. For example, see this documentation to learn how person authentication and consent gathering can be customized using interception scripts.

Many SSO solutions offer a proprietary endpoint to accomplish this. However, in Janssen server, this is accomplished with the OAuth/OpenID framework by using a combination of calling the /token endpoint using the OAuth password flow, and then redirecting to browser to the /authorization endpoint, but auto-submitting the form. This article describes how to process login via backchannel and when browser is processing authorization, AS will recognize automatically the authenticated user, write cookies and then establish the session. Design # Source-code for sequence diagram Title password Grant with State Person->Browser: Navigate to website Browser->Website: Website->Browser:Display login page Person->Browser: Enter Username / PW Browser->Website: (creds) Website->IDP: /token?uid=_&pw=&browser_ip=_ IDP->Website: {\"redirect\": \"/authz/state=1F2D41A\", ...} Website->Browser: Browser->IDP: /authz?state=1F2D41A IDP->IDP: check IP address is\\n same as state IDP->Browser: write cookie / send redirect_uri Browser->Website: redirect_uri Solution # In order to process the whole authorization, idea is to use resource owner password credentials grant type in the first stage, over there process the authentication as we do today, but also write in cache a short-lived token to recognize such authenticated user, then return to the client such short-lived token. During authorization, browser should send that token as part of the custom params and in the AS we should verify if that user is already authenticated using the short-lived param in the cache, then AS will write cookies, create the session and return to the client information required for this.

This article describes how to process login via backchannel and when browser is processing authorization, AS will recognize automatically the authenticated user, write cookies and then establish the session.","title":"Backchannel authentication scripts"},{"location":"admin/auth-server/endpoints/backchannel-authentication/#design","text":"Source-code for sequence diagram Title password Grant with State Person->Browser: Navigate to website Browser->Website: Website->Browser:Display login page Person->Browser: Enter Username / PW Browser->Website: (creds) Website->IDP: /token?uid=_&pw=&browser_ip=_ IDP->Website: {\"redirect\": \"/authz/state=1F2D41A\", ...} Website->Browser: Browser->IDP: /authz?state=1F2D41A IDP->IDP: check IP address is\\n same as state IDP->Browser: write cookie / send redirect_uri Browser->Website: redirect_uri","title":"Design"},{"location":"admin/auth-server/endpoints/backchannel-authentication/#solution","text":"In order to process the whole authorization, idea is to use resource owner password credentials grant type in the first stage, over there process the authentication as we do today, but also write in cache a short-lived token to recognize such authenticated user, then return to the client such short-lived token.

Client Registration Request Using a signed request object # In some usecases like FAPI implementation, DCR request payload is a JWT. Example: curl -X POST -k -H 'Content-Type: application/jwt' \\ -H 'Accept: application/json' \\ -i 'https://my-jans-server/jans-auth/restv1/register' \\ --data 'eyJraWQiOiJrWTIyZXBUT......ueOg2HkjpggwAEP84jq9Q' When such will be the nature of client registration requests, the following configuration properties should be set in the authorization server: - dcrSignatureValidationEnabled - enables DCR signature validation - dcrSignatureValidationJwksUri - specifies JWKS URI for all DCR's validations. - dcrSignatureValidationJwks - specifies JWKS for all DCR's validations. Configure the Janssen AS using steps explained in the link 4. Client registration using software statement # A signed assertion from a trusted party, a Software statement or Software Statement Assertion (SSA), is used to dynamically register clients to an Authorization server. Example: #!/bin/bash curl -X POST https://my.jans.server/jans-auth/restv1/register \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ --data-binary @- <<DATA \\ { \"redirect_uris\": [ \"https://client.example.org/cab1\" ], \\ \"software_statement\":\"eyJ0eXAi........j3ouyeYOv8\", \\ \"jwks_uri\":\"https://my.portal/portal/jwks\" \\ } DATA For Client registrations using Software statements, the AS should be configured using the following configuration parameters: - softwareStatementValidationType - The value of this variable is one of the following: - NONE - validation is skipped for software statement - SCRIPT - (default), invokes getSoftwareStatementJwks of dynamic registration script which has to return jwks. - JWKS - claim name within software statement that has inlined JWKS - JWKS_URI - claim name within software statement that points to JWKS URI that should lead to keys. - dcrSignatureValidationSoftwareStatementJwksURIClaim - specifies claim name inside software statement that should point to JWKS URI. - dcrSignatureValidationSoftwareStatementJwksClaim - specifies claim name inside software statement. Value of claim should point to inlined JWKS. Configure the AS using steps explained in the link 5. Special mention about FAPI: # In case of a typical client registration request in FAPI implementation , the request object which is a signed JWT (as seen in point 3) is also called an SSA (Software statement Assertion) or DCR payload. This SSA can contain the software_statement inside it which is also a signed JWT. Each of the JWTs, the outer JWT called the SSA and the inner JWT called the software_statement are signed by different entities - the TPP and OBIE respectively. Security Pointers # If dynamicRegistrationEnabled is enabled in the Authorization Server, assess the following points to minimize potential exposure of sensitive personal data: trustedClientEnabled and dynamicRegistrationPersistClientAuthorizations properties determine whether clients are trusted and if consent should be sought from the user before releasing their personal data to the RP dynamicRegistrationScopesParamEnabled controls whether default scopes are globally enabled. If dynamicRegistrationScopesParamEnabled is true then scopes defined as default will be automatically added to any dynamically registered client entry without consent of OP's administrator.

Request user and device codes # This first step, device sends an HTTP POST request to Jans authorization server, at /jans-auth/restv1/device_authorization which is also presented in the Discovery url published by Jans Server, this endpoint could process a common authentication method or it could also not do any authentication, depending on the configuration for the client in Jans Server. Parameters # Parameter Description client_id Required The client ID for your application. scope Required A space separated list of scopes that identify the resources that the device could access on the user's behalf. These values inform the consent screen that Jans server displays to the user. Example # POST /restv1/device_authorization HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Host: test.jans.org Authorization: Basic MTIzLTEyMy0xMjM6WkE1aWxpTFFDYUR4 client_id=123-123-123&scope=openid+profile+address+email+phone Device Request response # In response, the Jans authorization server generates a unique device verification code and an end-user code that are valid for a limited time and includes them in the HTTP response body using the \"application/json\" format with a 200 (OK) status code. The response contains the following parameters: Parameter Description user_code Required The end-user verification code device_code Required The device verification code verification_uri Required The end-user verification URI on the authorization server. This should be shown to the end-user because he should open this url in the rich user-agent. verification_uri_complete Optional This is similar than verification_uri , however it also includes user_code as a query param in the url. It's issued if the device wants to use QR mode for example. expires_in Required The lifetime in seconds of the device_code and user_code . interval Required The minimum amount of time in seconds that the client should wait between polling requests to the token endpoint. Example: # HTTP/1.1 200 Content-Length: 307 Content-Type: application/json Server: Jetty(9.4.19.v20190610) { \"user_code\": \"SJFP-DTPL\", \"device_code\": \"aeb28bdc90d806ac58d4b0f832f06c3ac9c4bd03292f0c09\", \"interval\": 5, \"verification_uri_complete\": \"https://test.jans.io:8443/device-code?user_code=SJFP-DTPL\", \"verification_uri\": \"https://test.jans.io:8443/device-code\", \"expires_in\": 1800 } Device Display # Common flow, the device should display verification_url and user_code received from Jans server. The content that the device displays to the user should instruct the user to navigate to the verification_url on a separate device and enter the user_code . Design device interface following these rules: user_code has the following format: XXXX-XXXX where Xs represent to any ASCII character, for example: RTXD-HTLK . The length of the user_code will be always the same, therefore it's highly recommended to show it as clear and big that the user can read it easly. verification_url should be displayed also in a way that the user can read it easily. The normal length should be around 40 characters, however it could depends also on the domain used for the server. Remember that the user will need to write the whole URL manually in the web browser, therefore it's recommended to use a short URL. verification_url_complete will be used for those cases where device can show QR (Quick Response) codes or NFC (Near Field Communication) to save the user from typing the whole URI. Interaction between device and Jans server will be the same, however user can process the authorization faster. For example: User Login & Authorization # The user will need to put user_code value in the browser and after that, he will be redirected to the common authorization flow, it requires login whether there is no session between the user-agent and the Jans server and grant the permissions based on the device request. Poll Token # Since the user will be using a separate device to navigate to the verification_url and grant or deny access, the requesting device is not automatically notified when the user responds to the access request. For that reason, the requesting device needs to poll the Jans Server to determine when the user has responded to the request. The requesting device should continue sending polling requests until it receives a response indicating that the user has responded to the access request or until the device_code expires. The parameter interval returned in step 2 specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait between requests. The URL of the endpoint to poll is /jans-auth/restv1/token . The polling request contains the following parameters: Parameters # Parameter Description client_id Required The client ID for your application. grant_type Required Must be urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code . device_code Required The device verification code which is returned by Jans server in Step 2. Authentication can be done using any of those authentication methods for this token endpoint. Example: # POST /restv1/token HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Host: test.jans.io Authorization: Basic MTIzLTEyMy0xMjM6WkE1aWxpTFFDYUR4 grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Adevice_code&device_code=0bd7068e7fdab4bb91b313296a96462256a7370d12f073f0 Token Response # The Jans authorization server responds to each polling request with one of the following responses: Access granted If the user granted access to the device (by clicking Allow on the consent screen), then the response contains an access token and a refresh token. The tokens enable the device to access to the resource server on the user's behalf. In this case, the server responds with all tokens required and allowed to be issued depending on the configuration in the server.

Janssen will either return the requested response back to the application, or return an error if the user is not already authenticated or if some type of consent or prompt is required before proceeding. Initiate Silent Authentication requests To initiate a silent authentication request, add the prompt=none parameter when you redirect a user to the /authorize endpoint of Janssen authentication API. (The individual parameters on the authentication request will vary depending on the specific needs of your app.) For example: GET https://YOUR_DOMAIN//authorize? response_type={response_type}& client_id={client_id}& scope={scope}& state={state}& ui_locales=& claims_locales=& acr_values=& redirect_uri={redirect_uri}& prompt=none Basic credential user The prompt=none parameter causes Jannsen to immediately send a result to the specified redirect_uri (callback URL) using the specified response_mode with one of two possible responses: success or error. Note: Any applicable rules will be executed as part of the silent authentication process. Successful authentication responses If the user was already logged in to Janssen and no other interactive prompts are required, Janssen will respond exactly as if the user had authenticated manually through the login page.

During an authentication workflow, Auth Server writes a cookie with the session_id in the person's browser. OpenID Native SSO defines a way for mobile apps from the same vendor to use the iOS or Android protected secret storage to store the session_id . By correlating the session, the IDP can return an identity assertion (id_token) to a client without needing to re-authenticate the person. SSO ensues. For example, let's say a person uses a browser to navigate to the website of Relying Party (RP1), which redirects to Jans Auth Server for authentication. Once the person is authenticated, the OP creates a session_id cookie, sets the state to authenticated , and places it in the cache. If the person mavigates their browser to the website of RP2, it redirects to the OP for authentication; since the session_id detected via the cookie is already authenticated, the OP authenticates the person automatically for RP2 (without an authentication prompt). Jans Auth Server stores user session data in its cache. Auth Server performance retrieving the session will vary depending on whether the session is stored in memory, Redis, Memcached or the database, as controlled by the cacheProviderType Auth Server configuration property. The Auth Server session can have one of two states: unauthenticated - a browser that has started, but not completed an authentication workflow. authenticated - when a person has successfully authenticated The following Auth Server configuration properties are related to sessions: sessionIdLifetime - lifetime of the OP session in seconds. It sets both the session_id cookie expiration property as well as the OP session object expiration (if serverSessionIdLifetime is not set or equals 0 which is default behavior) in the persistence. Upi cam set the value to 0 or -1, which means that expiration is not set. In this case, the sesion is valid until the browser session ends. Default value is 86400 . serverSessionIdLifetime - dedicated property to control lifetime of the server side OP session object in seconds. Overrides sessionIdLifetime . By default value is 0 , so object lifetime equals sessionIdLifetime (which sets both cookie and object expiration). It can be useful if goal is to keep different values for client cookie and server object. Default value is 86400 . sessionIdUnusedLifetime - unused OP session lifetime in seconds. If an OP session is not used for a given amount of time, the OP session is removed. Default value is 86400 . sessionIdUnauthenticatedUnusedLifetime - lifetime in seconds of unauthenticated OP session. This determines how long the user can be on the login page while unauthenticated. Default value is 120 . sessionIdRequestParameterEnabled - Boolean value specifying whether to enable session_id HTTP request parameter. Default value is False . sessionIdPersistOnPromptNone - specifies whether to persist or update the session object with data if prompt=none . Default value is True . invalidateSessionCookiesAfterAuthorizationFlow - this is special property which specifies whether to invalidate session_id and consent_session_id cookies right after successful or unsuccessful authorization. changeSessionIdOnAuthentication - Using a different session after the user authenticates improves security. The default value is True . sessionIdPersistInCache - If True, sessions are stored according to cacheProviderType . Otherwise, sessions are persisted in the database.

During an authentication workflow, Auth Server writes a cookie with the session_id in the person's browser. OpenID Native SSO defines a way for mobile apps from the same vendor to use the iOS or Android protected secret storage to store the session_id . By correlating the session, the IDP can return an identity assertion (id_token) to a client without needing to re-authenticate the person. SSO ensues. For example, let's say a person uses a browser to navigate to the website of Relying Party (RP1), which redirects to Jans Auth Server for authentication. Once the person is authenticated, the OP creates a session_id cookie, sets the state to authenticated , and places it in the cache. If the person mavigates their browser to the website of RP2, it redirects to the OP for authentication; since the session_id detected via the cookie is already authenticated, the OP authenticates the person automatically for RP2 (without an authentication prompt).

The command line: /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id delete-config-database-ldap-by-name --url-suffix name:test_ldap It will delete data ldap database configuration matched with the name. Patch LDAP Database Configurations # If required, We can patch single information of a ldap database configuration by using its name id.

Place the ip of the maching running the ide , here liclipse i.e 192.168.140.2 . if REMOTE_DEBUG: pydevd.settrace ( '<ip-of-machine-running-ide>' , port = 5678 , stdoutToServer = True, stderrToServer = True ) Save basic.py Within one minute, the auth server should load the changed file. Check the following log file again to make sure there are no load errors: /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/logs/jans-auth_script.log To check if the script works, update the default authentication method to Basic Authentication. Preform this in the LDAP browser. Navigate to o=jans,ou=configuration . Change the jansAuthMode to basic instead of simple_password_auth . After executing pydevd.settrace the script will transfer execution control to the PyDev server in Liclipse. You can use any debug commands. For example: Step Over (F6), Resume (F8), etc After debugging is finished, resume script execution to transfer execution control back to the auth server.","title":"Sample Scenario"},{"location":"admin/developer/interception-scripts/","tags":["administration","developer"],"text":"Interception Scripts (or custom scripts) # Interception scripts (or custom scripts) allow you to define custom business logic for various features offered by the OpenID Provider (Jans-auth server). Some examples of features which can be customized are - implementing a 2FA authentication method, consent gathering, client registration, adding business specific claims to ID token or Access token etc. Scripts can easily be upgraded and doesn't require forking the Jans Server code or re-building it. Types of Interception scripts in Jans server # Listed below, are custom scripts classified into various types, each of which represents a feature of the Jans server that can be extended as per the business need. Each script type is described by a java interface whose methods should be overridden to implement your business case. Person Authentication : Allows the definition of multi-step authentication workflows, including adaptive authentication - where the number of steps varies depending on the context. Consent Gathering : Allows exact customization of the authorization (or consent) process. By default, the OP will request authorization for each scope, and display the respective scope description. Update User Client Registration : Allows implementing custom business logic during dynamic client registration, including validating SSA's and granting scopes. Dynamic Scopes : Enables admin to generate scopes on the fly, for example by calling external APIs ID Generator Update Token : Enables transformation of claims and values in id_token, Access token and Refresh tokens; allows the setting of token lifetime; allows the addition or removal of scopes to / from tokens; allows the addition of audit logs each time a token is created. Session Management SCIM Introspection : Introspection scripts allows to modify response of Introspection Endpoint spec and present additional meta information surrounding the token. Post Authentication Resource Owner Password Credentials UMA 2 RPT Authorization Policies UMA 2 Claims-Gathering Implementation languages - Jython or pure Java # Interception scripts are written in Jython or in pure Java , enabling Java or Python libraries to be imported. Implementation in Pure Java # A script in Java refers to a java source file (e.g. Discovery.java ) which is compiled by AS and executed at runtime. Some rules: The java class file containing the script should not have a package set. The name of the class must match to the name set in CustomScriptType source code (e.g. for discovery script it is \"Discovery\") Scripts must implement predefined interface which can be found against the CustomScriptType . For e.g. if you are writing a Person authentication script then your class should implement the following interface All libraries available at runtime to server are available also to pure java script To log to jans-auth_script.log use scriptLogger Normal log will log in to jans-auth.log Example pure java script import io.jans.model.SimpleCustomProperty ; import io.jans.model.custom.script.model.CustomScript ; import io.jans.model.custom.script.type.discovery.DiscoveryType ; import io.jans.service.custom.script.CustomScriptManager ; import org.slf4j.Logger ; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory ; import org.json.JSONObject ; import java.util.Map ; /** * @author Yuriy Zabrovarnyy */ public class Discovery implements DiscoveryType { private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory . getLogger ( Discovery . class ); private static final Logger scriptLogger = LoggerFactory . getLogger ( CustomScriptManager . class ); @Override public boolean init ( Map < String , SimpleCustomProperty > configurationAttributes ) { log . info ( \"Init of Discovery Java custom script\" ); return true ; } @Override public boolean init ( CustomScript customScript , Map < String , SimpleCustomProperty > configurationAttributes ) { log . info ( \"Init of Discovery Java custom script\" ); return true ; } @Override public boolean destroy ( Map < String , SimpleCustomProperty > configurationAttributes ) { log . info ( \"Destroy of Discovery Java custom script\" ); return true ; } @Override public int getApiVersion () { log . info ( \"getApiVersion Discovery Java custom script: 11\" ); return 11 ; } @Override public boolean modifyResponse ( Object responseAsJsonObject , Object context ) { scriptLogger . info ( \"write to script logger\" ); JSONObject response = ( JSONObject ) responseAsJsonObject ; response . accumulate ( \"key_from_java\" , \"value_from_script_on_java\" ); return true ; } } Using Java libraries in a script: # Steps: 1. Add library jars to /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/libs/ 2. Edit /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/webapps/jans-auth.xml and add the following line replacing the word library-name with the actual name of the library: <Set name=\"extraClasspath\">/opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/libs/library-name.jar</Set> 3. Restart jans-auth service systemctl restart jans-auth Implementation in Jython # The example below is only meant to convey the concept, we will cover the details in later parts of the documentation. Suppose, we are implementing an Openbanking Identity platform and we have to add business specific claims say openbanking_intent_id to the ID token. The custom script which will help us accomplish our goal is of the type UpdateTokenType where the modifyIdToken method has to be implemented. A sample custom script with this business logic will be as stated below: class UpdateToken ( UpdateTokenType ): def __init__ ( self , currentTimeMillis ): self . currentTimeMillis = currentTimeMillis def init ( self , customScript , configurationAttributes ): < initialization code comes here > return True def destroy ( self , configurationAttributes ): < clean up code comes here > return True def getApiVersion ( self ): return < version number > def modifyIdToken ( self , jsonWebResponse , context ): # Step1: <get openbanking_intent_id from session > sessionId = context . getSession () openbanking_intent_id = sessionId . getSessionAttributes () . get ( \"openbanking_intent_id \" ) # Step2: <add custom claims to ID token here> jsonWebResponse . getClaims () . setClaim ( \"openbanking_intent_id \" , openbanking_intent_id ) Using Java libraries in a Jython script: # Steps: 1. Add library jars to /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/libs/ 2. Edit /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/webapps/jans-auth.xml and add the following line replacing the word library-name with the actual name of the library: <Set name=\"extraClasspath\">/opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/libs/library-name.jar</Set> 3. Restart jans-auth service systemctl restart jans-auth Using Python libraries in a script: # You can only use libraries (packages and modules) that are written in Pure Python . Importing a Python class which is a wrapper around a library written in C is not supported by the Jans server. As an example, the psycopg2 library used to connect to PostgreSQL from Python. Since it is a C wrapper around libpq, it won't work with Jython. Python 3 packages / modules are not supported. Steps: 1. Pure Python libraries should be added to /opt/jans/python/libs Using pip to install additional Python packages: Find out about your Jython version first. cd into the /opt directory in your Jans Server container and run ls. A directory named jython- should be listed too where will correspond to the Jython version. Note the version. Open the file /etc/jans/conf/jans.properties and look for the line starting with pythonModulesDir= . Append the value /opt/jython-<version>/Lib/site-packages to any existing value. Each value is separater by a colon (:). It should look something like this pythonModulesDir=/opt/jans/python/libs:/opt/jython-2.7.2a/Lib/site-packages Run the following command /opt/jython-<version>/bin/jython -m ensurepip Install your library with /opt/jython-<version>/bin/pip install <library_name> where is the name of the library to install. Restart the jans-auth service : systemctl restart jans-auth Debugging a Jython script # This article covers the details for debugging a script in a developer environment (CE). This article covers the details for debugging a script in a CN environment. Mandatory methods to be overridden # This is the base class of all custom script types and all custom scripts should implement the following methods. * init(self, customScript, configurationAttributes) : This method is only called once during the script initialization (or jans-auth service restarts). It can be used for global script initialization, initiate objects etc destroy(self, configurationAttributes) : This method is called when a custom script fails to initialize or upon jans-auth service restarts. It can be used to free resource and objects created in the init() method getApiVersion(self, configurationAttributes, customScript) : The getApiVersion method allows API changes in order to do transparent migration from an old script to a new API. Only include the customScript variable if the value for getApiVersion is greater than 10 Configurable properties of a custom script # Property Description Name unique identifier(name) for the custom script e.g. person_authentication_google Description Description Text Programming Languages Python/Java Level Used in Person Authentication script type, the strength of the credential is a numerical value assigned to the custom script that is tied to the authentication method. The higher the value, the stronger it is considered. Thus, if a user has several credentials enrolled, he will be asked to present the one of them having the highest strength associated. Location type Database - Stored in persistence (LDAP, MYSQL or PLSQL whichever applicable ) File - stored as a file Interactive Web - web application native - mobile application both Custom Properties Key - value pairs for configurable parameters like Third Party API keys, location of configuration files etc Building business logic in a custom script # Jans-auth server uses Weld 3.0 (JSR-365 aka CDI 2.0) for managed beans. The most common business functions are implemented through a set of beans. This article presents many ready-to-use beans which can be used to build a script. Operations on custom scripts using jans-cli # Jans-cli supports the following six operations on custom scripts: get-config-scripts , gets a list of custom scripts. post-config-scripts , adds a new custom script. put-config-scripts , updates a custom script. get-config-scripts-by-type , requires an argument --url-suffix TYPE: ______ . You can specify the following types: PERSON_AUTHENTICATION, INTROSPECTION, RESOURCE_OWNER_PASSWORD_CREDENTIALS, APPLICATION_SESSION, CACHE_REFRESH, UPDATE_USER, USER_REGISTRATION, CLIENT_REGISTRATION, ID_GENERATOR, UMA_RPT_POLICY, UMA_RPT_CLAIMS, UMA_CLAIMS_GATHERING, CONSENT_GATHERING, DYNAMIC_SCOPE, SPONTANEOUS_SCOPE, END_SESSION, POST_AUTHN, SCIM, CIBA_END_USER_NOTIFICATION, PERSISTENCE_EXTENSION, IDP, or UPDATE_TOKEN. get-config-scripts-by-inum , requires an argument --url-suffix inum: _____ delete-config-scripts-by-inum , requires an argument --url-suffix inum: _____ The post-config-scripts and put-config-scripts require various details about the scripts. The following command gives the basic schema of the custom scripts to pass to these operations. Basic schema of a custom script # Command: /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --schema CustomScript Output: { \"dn\" : \"string\" , \"inum\" : \"string\" , \"name\" : \"string\" , \"aliases\" : [ \"string\" ], \"description\" : \"string\" , \"script\" : \"string\" , \"scriptType\" : \"ciba_end_user_notification\" , \"programmingLanguage\" : \"python\" , \"level\" : 45 , \"revision\" : 156 , \"enabled\" : true , \"scriptError\" : { \"raisedAt\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" , \"format\" : \"date-time\" }, \"stackTrace\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" } }, \"modified\" : true , \"internal\" : true , \"locationType\" : \"file\" , \"locationPath\" : \"string\" , \"baseDn\" : \"string\" } To add or modify a script first, we need to create the script's python file (e.g. /tmp/sample.py) and then create a JSON file by following the above schema and update the fields as : /tmp/sample.json { \"name\" : \"mySampleScript\" , \"aliases\" : null , \"description\" : \"This is a sample script\" , \"script\" : \"_file /tmp/sample.py\" , \"scriptType\" : \"PERSON_AUTHENTICATION\" , \"programmingLanguage\" : \"PYTHON\" , \"moduleProperties\" : [ { \"value1\" : \"mayvalue1\" , \"value2\" : \"myvalues2\" , \"description\" : \"description for property\" } ], \"configurationProperties\" : null , \"level\" : 1 , \"revision\" : 0 , \"enabled\" : false , \"scriptError\" : null , \"modified\" : false , \"internal\" : false } Add, Modify and Delete a script # The following command will add a new script with details given in /tmp/sample.json file.

With Agama, flows are coded using a DSL (domain specific language) designed for the sole purpose of writing web flows. Important Here, a web flow is understood as a process composed by one or more stages, where at each stage an actor - normally a person - provides some kind of data or response by using a web browser or similar client. Throughout the process only a single actor is involved Some of the advantages of using Agama include: Ability to express authentication flows in a clean and concise way Flow composition is supported out-of-the-box: reuse of an existing flow in another requires no effort Reasoning about flows behavior is straightforward (as consequence of points 1 and 2). This makes flow modifications easy Small cognitive load. Agama DSL is a very small language with simple, non-distracting syntax Friendly UI templating engine. No complexities when authoring web pages - stay focused on writing HTML markup Scope and intended audience # Agama brings a lot of power to the table. In general, developers will be able to write arbitrary flows, ranging from very simple to multi-step non-linear dynamic flows. The effort required varies widely and depends on the underlying complexity and developer ability.

With jython scripts, an inversion of control (IoC) mechanism is employed where control jumps from one method to another in a script Despite the above, if you have coded jython authentication scripts in the past, this may represent an advantage since you will probably have acquaintance with some of the auth-server Java APIs. Agama engine # The Agama engine (a.k.a the \" engine \") is the piece of software in charge of reading flows written in Agama DSL and put them into action.

Examples: \"Agama\" , \"blah\" , \"\" (empty string) Backslash can be used to escape chars, like \"Hello\\nGluu\" (line feed), \"Hi\\u0040\" (unicode character) Including double quotes in strings requires unicode escaping, like \"\\u0022\" . Using \"\\\"\" won't work Booleans # Only true or false allowed (notice they are lowercased) Numbers # They are expressed in base 10 only Can be signed or unsigned, with or without decimal: 0 , -1 , 2.0 , 2.3 , -3.000001 , etc. No exponential notation allowed (e.g. 1E-05 ) The following are not valid: .1 , -.1 , +1 . These are their OK equivalents: 0.1 , -0.1 , 1 Null # The \u201cspecial\u201d value null can be used (responsibly) to represent the absence of a value. It is a direct consequence of supporting Java in the DSL. Lists # They are finite sequences. Elements are separated by commas Examples: [ 1, 2, 3 ] , [ \"bah!\", \"humbug\" ] , [ ] (empty list) Elements of a list do not have to be of the same type: [ false, [ 0, 1], \"?\" ] is legal but generally discouraged Commas can be surrounded by any combination of spaces and new lines. This is handy when a list takes up some space. This is legal: [ \"no\", \"such\", \"thing\" , \"as\", \"a\", \"stupid\",\"question\"] Maps # They are in essence associative arrays (a.k.a. dictionaries): unordered collections of key/value pairs Example: { brand: \"Ford\", color: null, model: 1963, overhaulsIn: [ 1979, 1999 ] } . This map keys are brand , color , model , and overhaulsIn In literal notation, keys names must follow the pattern [a-zA-Z]( _ | [a-zA-Z] | [0-9] )* so these are all valid key names: a , Agama , b_a , a0_0 ; on the contrary, _a , 9 , -a , and \"aha\" are invalid key names As with lists, commas can be surrounded by any combination of spaces and new lines Variables # Variable names follow the pattern: [a-zA-Z]( _ | [a-zA-Z] | [0-9] )* camelCase naming is recommended Variables are not declared, just used freely. Variables are always global in a given flow They can be assigned a value using the equal sign. Example: colors = [ \"red\", \"blue\" ] They can be assigned several times in the same flow Accessing and mutating data in variables # Strings # Suppose x is a string. Individual characters can be accessed by zero-based indexes: x[0] , x[1] , etc. and they are themselves considered strings of size 1 x.length returns the string size (number of characters in it). Strings are not modifiable (neither size nor individual characters can be altered) Lists # Suppose x is a list. Elements can be accessed by zero-based indexes: x[0] , x[1] , etc. Elements of a list can be assigned (and re-assigned) using indexes too. Example: x[2] = false x.length returns the list size. This value can be updated in order to shrink or grow a list (e.g. x.length = 10 ). When extending a list beyond its current length, the \u201cgap\u201d created is filled with null values An attempt to access an index position greater than or equal to the list size returns null (most general-purpose languages would raise a runtime error in this situation) Using expressions for indexing is not allowed, like x[person.age] , x[y[0]] Click here to learn more about access in lists Maps # Suppose x is map. Values can be accessed by using \u201cdot notation\u201d Say x = { brand: \"Ford\", color: null, model: 1963, overhaulsIn: [ 1979, 1999 ] } , then x.model evaluates to 1963 , and x.overhaulsIn[1] evaluates to 1999 Setting the color would be like x.color = \"white\" A new key/value pair can be appended too: x.maxSpeed = 90 Access of an unknown property evaluates to null : x.owner If a key name does not follow the pattern [a-zA-Z]( _ | [a-zA-Z] | [0-9] )* an alternative notation must be employed to retrieve or modify the associated value. Click here to learn more Java objects # The following table relates Java types to Agama types. Java values are obtained through Call invocations (this will be visited in section Java interaction ). Java value ( x ) Agama equivalent Notes x is a Java array or implements java.util.List list Changing the list contents (includes updates on x.length) can only be achieved if the Java list is modifiable x implements java.util.Map and keys are of type java.lang.String map Changing the map contents can only be achieved if the Java map is modifiable x is a java.lang.(Double|Float|Long|Integer|Short|Byte) or an equivalent primitive number x is a (non-null) java.lang.Boolean or equivalent primitive boolean x is a java.lang.String string (limited) Neither indexing nor x.length can be used null null Except for maps, the following holds for a value x obtained through a Java Call : If x 's class has getters and/or setters for some fields, they can be called. As an example if age and name are available fields, x.age can be used to get the value of age Likewise, setting a value is possible too: x.name = \"Larry\" (if a suitable setter exists) In general, a no-args method starting with get or is can be invoked. This is useful for instance to get the (Java) class name of your object ( x.class.name ) or determine if a list has no elements ( x.empty ) In real flows developers would like to prefix a variable name with j when its value originates in a java call and does not match any of Agama types. Example: jCustomerDetail . Flow structure # A flow written in Agama consists of a header and one or more statements following. Header basics # A header is declarative by nature. It starts with the Flow keyword followed by the qualified name of the flow, e.g. Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey . A qualified name is a sequence of one or more fragments separated by dot ( . ) where a fragment follows the pattern [a-zA-Z]( _ | [a-zA-Z] | [0-9] )* . By convention, qualified names shall adhere to a reverse Internet domain name notation. In a header, at minimum, a base path literal string must be provided (in an indented block). This sets the relative directory where flow assets will reside: Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Next, flow timeout may be specified. This is the maximum amount of time the end-user can take to fully complete a flow. For instance: Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Timeout 100 seconds An unsigned integer literal value must be specified after the Timeout keyword, if present. The timeout topic is regarded in Flows lifecycle . The Configs keyword may be used to designate a variable so the flow's properties can be accessed in the code. These properties are part of the flow metadata and are usually provided when the flow is created - whether manually or through an administrative tool. Often, these are used to supply configuration parameters to the flow. As an example, suppose a flow that sends a confirmation e-mail has to be implemented. Properties are a good place to hold the configuration of the outgoing mail server to employ: name, port, authentication credentials, etc. For instance, this is how the configuration properties would be bound to variable conf : Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Timeout 100 seconds Configs conf Inputs # In addition to the above, and optionally too, flows may receive inputs from their callers. Input names can be listed using the Inputs keyword: Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Inputs salutation askGender promptRealName Input names follow the same naming conventions (patterns) of variables and can be treated as such in code. Important Note the difference between properties and inputs. Properties are parameters that callers of the flow should not control or be interested in. On the other hand, inputs are parameters that callers supply explicitly to make the flow exhibit certain behaviors. To learn how callers can pass values to input parameters of a flow check: Subflows , or Authentication request (when the flow is launched directly from a web browser) Flow statements # The statements that make up a flow - body - come after the header and start at column 1, ie. aligned with the Flow keyword: Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Timeout 100 seconds Configs conf Inputs salutation askGender promptRealName x = \"Hi\" y = false ... There are several types of statements: branching, looping, web interaction, etc. They will be regarded in the subsequent sections of this document. Note Agama does not support the concept of subroutines/procedures; this is not needed because functional decomposition is carried out by calling subflows . Logging # To append data to the flows log, use the Log instruction. Examples: Code Message appended Notes Log \"Hi there\" Hi there Log \"Hello\" \"world\" Hello world Log can be passed a variable number of parameters Log \"Hello\" \"world\" 0 false Hello world 0 false Log [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 1, 2, 3, ...more Lists and maps are not traversed wholly Log \"Hell%% 0 %\" \"o\" \" world\" false Hello world 0 false Placeholders usage Log \"% % % yes\" 1 \"two\" 1 two % yes Log \"3\" \"%\" 0 3 % 0 Log \"@warn Today is Friday %th\" 13 Today is Friday 13th Message logged as warning Log \"@w Today's Armageddon \\u263A\" Today's Armageddon \u263a Message logged as warning By default messages are logged at the INFO level. Valid log levels are: Name shortcut error e warn w info i debug d trace t Conditionals and branching # Keywords When and Otherwise allow to write conditionals. With and , or , is , and is not , logical (boolean) expressions can be built. Examples: car = { brand: \"Ford\", color: null, model: 1963 } When car.color is null car.color = \"pink\" ... Nested conditionals: ... When car.color is \"pink\" When car.brand is \"Ford\" Log \"Weird-looking car\" ... Use of Otherwise : ... When car.color is not null Log \"you have a regular painted car\" ... Otherwise ... Boolean expressions can span several lines: and and or can be at the start or end of a line as long as the whole expression is left-aligned with its corresponding When . Examples: //legal: When day is cloudy When there is hope and there is mercy Log \"let's rock n' roll\" ... When day is cloudy When there is hope and // :D there is mercy or fear is null Log \"let's rock n' roll\" ... //illegal: When day is cloudy When there is hope and // :D there is mercy or fear is null Log \"let's rock n' roll\" ... When day is cloudy When there is hope and // :D there is mercy or fear is null Log \"let's rock n' roll\" ... Notes: Equality is designed to work with null , numbers, strings, and boolean values only. More exactly, a number should only be compared to a number, a string to a string, etc., otherwise the equality test evaluates to false . Comparing a value with itself evaluates to true regardless of type, i.e. car is car , null is null , false is false are all truthy. Comparisons are limited to equality ( is ) or inequality ( is not ). For other forms of comparison you can resort to Java. As expected and has higher priority than or when evaluating expressions. There is no way to group expressions to override the precedence: there are no parenthesis in Agama. Assigning the result of a boolean expression to a variable is not supported. These restrictions are important when writing conditionals. Advanced matching # Agama's Match ... to is a construct similar to C/Java switch . Example: car = ... x = ... y = ... // Assume x and y hold numbers z = [ 3.1416, 2.71828 ] Match car.model to x //Code in this block will be executed if car.model is equal to the value of x ... -y //Here we use minus y ... z[0] ... 1.618 //Literal values can be used too for matching ... null ... Otherwise //optional block //Instructions here are executed if there was no match at all Flow finish # Finish is used to terminate a flow's execution. A flow can finish successfully, failed, or aborted. Examples: Code Meaning Finish true Shorthand for flow finished successfully Finish false Shorthand for failed flow it = { success: true, data: { userId: \"as9233Qz\", ... }} Finish it Flow finished successfully. Some relevant data attached it = { success: false, error: \"User entered a wrong password 3 times\" } Finish it Flow failed. Error description attached Finish \"as9233Qz\" Shorthand for { success: true, data: { userId: \"as9233Qz\" } } it = { nonsense: [ null ] } Finish it.nonsense This causes the flow to crash. Note this is not equivalent to Finish false (which means the flow ended with a negative outcome). Notes: Any statements found after Finish is not reached and thus, not executed If no Finish statement is found in a flow's execution, this will degenerate in flow crash When a flow is finished and was used as subflow (part of the execution of a bigger parent flow), the parent does not terminate. Execution continues at the following instruction that triggered the subflow. More on Trigger later A flow cannot be aborted by itself. This can only be achieved through a parent flow. Learn more about aborted flows here Check the best practices on finishing flows here Web interaction # Web interaction constructs bring the most value to Agama. Developers can express the concepts of \u201dredirect a user to an external site and retrieve any data later provided\u201d or \u201cshow a page and grab user data after interaction\u201d using atomic instructions. RFAC # RFAC (stands for Redirect and Fetch at callback ) abstracts the process of redirecting the user's browser to an external site and then collect the data presented later at a designated callback URL. This feature is useful in inbound identity scenarios (e.g. to support social login). Example Details RFAC \"https://login.twitter.com/?blah..&boo=...\" Redirects to the given location. Once the user browser is taken to the callback URL by the external site (twitter.com), the flow continues ignoring any data included map = { twitter: { loginUrl: \"https://...\", ... }, ... } result = RFAC map.twitter.loginUrl Redirects to the given location. Once the user browser is taken to the callback URL by the external site, the data included in the query string or payload is stored in result (a map) for further processing Agama engine's callback URL is https://<your-server>/jans-auth/fl/callback . This resource is only available for a given browser session while RFAC is in execution. Once the callback is visited or the flow times out (whichever occurs first), subsequent requests will respond with an HTTP 404 error. The mechanism used for redirection is a \"302 Found\" HTTP redirect that entails a subsequent GET request to the external site. In cases where a POST is expected, the 3-param version of RRF can be useful. RRF # RRF (stands for Render-Reply-Fetch ) abstracts the process of rendering a UI template, send the produced markup to the browser and grab user-provided data back at the server side. Example Details RRF \"survey.ftl\" Renders the template survey.ftl (located in this flow's base path) and resulting markup is replied to user's browser. Data submitted by the user is ignored obj = { salutation: \"Hey!\", ... } result = RRF \"survey.ftl\" obj Renders the template survey.ftl by injecting the data passed in obj and the resulting markup is replied to user's browser. Data submitted by the user is stored in variable result : a map whose keys are named according to the form fields present in survey.ftl Notes: The template location must be specified with a string literal only (not a variable). Normally the template must submit a POST to the current URL with the desired data. In HTML terms, it would look like <form method=\"post\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\">... for instance. Use map variables - not literals - for the second argument of RRF . Objects obtained from Java can be used except collections, arrays, strings, numbers, or boolean values. 3-param variant # RRF can be passed a third parameter: RRF templatePath variable boolean . When the boolean value is true a callback URL will be available while RRF is in execution (see RFAC ). In this case, if the callback is visited, data passed to it will be set as the result of the RRF . If a POST to the current URL is received first, i.e. callback not hit, behavior will be as in the two-param RRF invocation. This is also the case when a false value is passed for the third parameter. The three-param variant of RRF can be useful when: The decision to redirect to an external site can only be done from the browser itself The external site expects to receive an HTTP POST. In this case, the rendered template may contain a form with fields as needed plus auto-submission logic in Javascript to perform the actual POST. This typically occurs in inbound-identity flows where identity providers require authentication requests serialized in application/x-www-form-urlencoded format as is the case of SAML HTTP POST binding, for example Looping # There are two constructs available for looping in Agama: Repeat and Iterate over . Repeat # Repeat was designed with the concept of attempts/retries in mind: a set of statements are executed, a condition can optionally be supplied in order to abort the loop early, and (optionally too) a block of statements can be executed before the next iteration is started if the condition evaluated to false . A loop is given a maximum number of iterations. Examples: Example Notes month = \"\u2026\" Repeat 3 times max data = RRF \"guess_birthday_month.ftl\" //Quit is optional in loops Quit When data.guess is month A loop that runs 3 iterations at most. A page is shown at every iteration. If the value entered by the user matches that of `month` variable, the loop is aborted earlier x = \u2026 // an integer value month = \"\u2026\" obj = { error: null } Repeat x times max data = RRF \"guess_birthday_month.ftl\" obj Quit When data.guess is month obj.error = \"Wrong! try again\" Similar to previous example This time the max no. of iterations is set using a variable When there is a miss a message error is set (which the UI template may potentially use) x = \u2026 // an integer value month = \"\u2026\" obj = { error: null } y = Repeat x times max data = RRF \"guess_birthday_month.ftl\" obj Quit When data.guess is month obj.error = \"Wrong! try again\" Log \"Attempt number:\" idx[0] Similar to previous example After the loop finishes, variable y will contain the total number of iterations made to completion. This excludes partial iterations aborted by Quit , thus, y < = x Note the usage of implicit variable idx which holds the current (zero-based) iteration number Iterate over # Iterate over is used to traverse the items of a string, list, or the keys of a map. At every iteration, a variable is set with the current item or key name. As with Repeat , a loop may be aborted earlier, an optional block of statements can be specified after Quit , and the total number of iterations can be stored in a variable. Example Notes seasons = [ \"spring\", \"winter\", \"fall\", \"summer\" ] Iterate over seasons using sn Log \"There is nothing like\" sn A loop running over a simple list. Every element visited is referenced with variable sn human = { weight: 100, height: 5.9, age: 26 } Iterate over human using attribute Log attribute \"is\" human.$attribute Iterates over the keys of the map printing both the key and its associated value. To learn about the .$ notation see [Maps and dot notation](#maps-and-dot-notation) seasons = [ \"spring\", \"winter\", \"fall\", \"summer\" ] sports = [ \"soccer\", \"golf\", \"tennis\" ] Iterate over seasons using sn Iterate over sports using sport Log \"There is nothing like playing % in %\" sport sn Nested loops seasons = [ \"spring\", \"winter\", \"fall\", \"summer\" ] sports = [ \"soccer,\" \"golf\", \"tenis\" ] Iterate over seasons using sn y = Iterate over sports using sport Log \"Shall we play % in % ?\" sport sn Quit When sn is \"winter\" Log \"yes!\" Log \"We played % sports in %\" y sn Similar to the previous example. The inner loop is aborted upon a given condition. Note the total number of complete iterations is recorded in y every time the inner loop finishes. seasons = [ \"spring\", \"winter\", \"fall\", \"summer\" ] sports = [ \"soccer,\" \"golf\", \"tenis\" ] Iterate over seasons using sn Iterate over sports using sport Log idx[0] idx[1] Prints iteration numbers: 0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 1 0, 1 1, 1 2, ... 3 2 The index used in idx is 0 for the outermost loop and increases by one at every level of loop nesting Subflows # A flow can Trigger another flow (a.k.a subflow) and grab its response when Finish ed. This feature materializes flow composition and re-use in Agama. Example Notes Trigger jo.jo.PersonalInfoGathering Starts the flow with qualified name jo.jo.PersonalInfoGathering . Returned data is ignored outcome = Trigger jo.jo.PersonalInfoGathering null false Log \"subflow returned with success?\" outcome.success Starts a flow passing parameters (assuming PersonalInfoGathering receives two inputs). outcome will contain the map used when the subflow ended userPrefs = { otp: \"...\", ... } Match userPrefs.otp to \"e-mail\" flow = \"co.acme.EmailOTP\" \"sms\" flow = \"co.acme.SmsOTP\" Trigger $flow Starts a flow whose qualified name is determined at runtime Input parameters # The values passed after the Trigger keyword are supplied as input parameters in the order declared by the subflow's Inputs . When not enough values are passed, the unassigned inputs will hold a null value. Note list and map literals cannot be passed as arguments to Trigger : Illegal: Trigger subflow { key: [ 1, 2 , 3] } [ \"Yeeha!\" ] Legal: Trigger subflow x car.model list[1] null false -3 \"Sam\" Template overrides # When re-using flows, existing templates may not match the required look-and-feel or layout of the flow that is being built, or may require minor adjustments to fit better the parent's needs. These can be overcome by declaring which templates the developer would like to override for a given subflow call. Example: outcome = Trigger jo.jo.PersonalInfoGathering Override templates \"path/basic.ftl\" \"\" \"path2/dir/detail.ftl\" \"tmp/mydetail.ftl\" Log \"subflow returned with success?\" outcome.success In an indented block using the Override templates keyword, several string literals can be provided. They specify the paths of the (subflows) templates that will be overriden by the parent and the corresponding new paths. In the example above, templates path/basic.ftl and path2/dir/detail.ftl rendered by flow PersonalInfoGathering (or its subflows) won't be picked from these locations but from the base path of the current (parent) flow using names basic.ftl and tmp/mydetail.ftl respectively. Usage of empty string denotes reusing the same file name than the original file. Alternatively, every pair of original vs. overriden path can be specified in a single line for more clarity, like this: outcome = Trigger jo.jo.PersonalInfoGathering Override templates \"path/basic.ftl\" \"\" \"path2/dir/detail.ftl\" \"tmp/mydetail.ftl\" ... To learn more about how paths in template overrides work, see writing UI pages . About recursive invocations # A flow cannot trigger itself. Also, mutual calls (e.g. A triggering B , and B triggering A ) must be avoided at all cost. Java interaction # Note Java language background is required for this section. In Agama, Java or Groovy code can be called by means of the Call instruction. Specifically, public methods from public classes or static methods from public interfaces. Example Notes Call java.lang.Integer#parseInt \"FF\" 16 Invokes the parseInt method of Integer class passing the given arguments (i.e. conversion of hexadecimal string to a primitive int ). The returned value is ignored numbers = [ 2, -2, 0, 3, -3, 4 ] small = Call java.util.Collections#min numbers Invokes the min method of the Collections class. Supplies a list of numbers as argument. The smallest number is stored in variable small jLocale = Call java.util.Locale#getDefault localeName = jLocale.displayName Computes the display name of the JVM default locale car = { brand: \"Ford\", model: 1963 } sidecar = Call java.util.Map#copyOf car Makes a deep clone of a map number | E = Call java.lang.Integer#parseInt \"AGA\" 16 When E is not null Log \"An error occurred:\" E.message Similar to the first example. If an exception is thrown by the invocation, it's caught and assigned to variable E . Note both checked and unchecked exceptions are caught | E = Call com.acme.Worker#notifyExternalSystem //Do something with E //... If exception catching is required when calling a method that returns void , there is no need to put a variable before the pipe p1 = Call java.awt.Point#new p2 = Call java.awt.Point#new 1 3 Call p2 translate -1 1 Creates instances of class java.awt.Point with different constructors. For p1 the no-args constructor is used. Method translate is invoked on the p2 instance. Note usage of a space here instead of hash ( # ) cls1 = Call java.lang.CharSequence#class cls2 = Call java.lang.Integer#class Call cls2 parseInt \"FF\" 16 Stores in cls1 a reference to interface class CharSequence.class . Stores in cls2 a reference to Integer.class . The 3rd line statement achieves the same effect of Call java.lang.Integer#parseInt \"FF\" 16 L = [ \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" ] S = Call java.util.Set#of 0 2 4 6 map = { numbers: S, letters: L } hasOne = Call map.numbers contains 1 Calls the contains method of the java.util.Set object stored in map.numbers passing 1 as argument and storing the result in hasOne The usage of a hash sign (or spaces) before a method name helps disambiguate whether the invocation is on a static class method or an object method. This is so because an expression like hey.You may reference the class You on package hey , or the value of key You in a map named hey . Highlights # Any method that meets the conditions mentioned (public or interface static) and that is reachable in the JVM classpath can be called; developers are not restricted solely to java.* packages. When using Call , the method to execute is picked based on the name (e.g. after the # sign) and the number of arguments supplied. If a class/interface exhibits several methods with the same name and arity (number of parameters), there is no way to know which of the available variants will be called. The java.util.Arrays class has several methods of this kind for instance. For non-static method invocations, i.e. no hash sign, the class used for method lookup is that of the instance passed (the first parameter in the Call directive). When the instance does not hold a Java but an Agama value, the following is used to pick a class: Agama type Java class for method lookup string String boolean Boolean number Double list java.util.List map java.util.Map Once a concrete method is selected, a best effort is made to convert (if required) the values passed as arguments so that they match the expected parameter types in the method signature. If a conversion fails, this will degenerate in an IllegalArgumentException . More on conversions here . Limitations: list and map literals cannot be passed as arguments to method calls directly. This means the following is illegal: Call co.Utils#myMethod { key: [ 1, 2 , 3] } [ \"Yeeha!\" ] . To achieve the same effect assign the literal value to a variable and pass that instead Call ing a method that mutates one or more of the arguments passed will not work properly if the corresponding parameters in the method signature have type information attached. For example, copying a list into another using java.util.Collections#copy\u200b(List<? super T> dest, List<? extends T> src) may not behave as expected. Conversely, calling java.lang.reflect.Array#set\u200b(Object array, int index, Object value) works fine because array does not have a parameterized type. The practice of mutating passed arguments is unusual and sometimes discouraged in programming Exception handling # As seen in the examples Agama can deal with Java exceptions, however, this feature should be used sparingly. When exception handling adds undesired complexity to your code, create wrapper methods in Java and do the processing there instead of delegating that to the DSL. Arguments conversion # Agama types do not match Java types. This means passing a \"native\" Agama value as parameter in a method Call requires some form of compatibility with the target (Java) type in the method signature. Earlier , we saw how some Java values returned from Call s can be treated in Agama code in a very straightforward manner, here we make an analysis in the reverse direction: from Agama to Java. An argument (Agama value) is compatible with a method parameter if it can be \"converted\" successfully. As we'll see, conversion feels pretty natural in practice. If this process fails a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException is thrown and the flow will crash unless the exception is caught. Note however the recommended practice is to let flows crash . The following lists some of the most common successful conversions: Agama value Can be converted to string String or char[] boolean Boolean or primitive equivalent number Double / Float / Integer / Long / Short / Byte or primitive equivalent null Any non-primitive list Array or class implementing Collection<T> as long as items can be converted to type T map Class implementing Map<K, V> as long as keys and values can be converted to types K and V , respectively map Java bean. Unrecognized properties in Agama value are ignored The below table shows some examples of interesting and handy conversions: Agama value Param data type in target Java method Argument value (Agama) Received param value (in method) Notes Positive number having fractional part Integer / Long / Short / Byte or primitive equivalent 2.6 2 Integer part kept Negative number having fractional part Integer / Long / Short / Byte or primitive equivalent -2.4 2 Integer part kept Integer number Float / Double or primitive equivalent 1 1.0 list of number s List<Integer> [1, 2.0, 3.1, -4.2] [1, 2, 3, -4] Only integer parts kept list of integer number s List<Float> / List<Double> [1, 2, 3, -4] [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, -4.0] string of length 1 Character or primitive equivalent a a Passing a zero, two, or more lengthed string will make the call fail When the argument is not an Agama but a Java object/primitive, the following rules apply: If the value can be cast to the target type, no conversion is needed, otherwise If it is an instance of java.lang.Number and the type is a numeric primitive or wrapper (e.g. Integer ), the value is truncated if required, otherwise The value is serialized to JSON - if possible - and then an attempt to create a Java instance based on the given JSON contents is made. For this purpose, the FasterXML Jackson library is used This is powerful because it allows to send data of similar shape/structure when data types do not necessarily match. Consider the following example: s = \"a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\" jStrArr = Call s split \" \" words = Call java.util.Collections#unmodifiableSet jStrArr This Agama snippet creates the (Java) Set of different words found in a given (Agama) string . Note jStrArr is of type String[] and is passed directly to method unmodifiableSet which originally expects an instance of Set as parameter. OOP prose warning # Java support adds the ability to execute pieces of business logic required to build up a flow. These \u201cpieces of logic\u201d match well to Java methods, however situations like this must be avoided: x = \u2026 // A java object obtained in some way y = \u2026 // A java object obtained in some way Call x methodA arg1 arg2 \u2026 Call x methodB arg1 arg2 arg3 \u2026 z = Call y methodC \u2026 Call x methodD \u2026 z \u2026 If all those calls represent a meaningful unit of work they should be abstracted out and grouped into a single method invocation which should be thoroughly implemented in Java. Note Agama should not be used to do object-oriented programming but to make a clear, concise representation of a flow. As a rule of thumb, let Java do the heavy work; this is wiser, safer, and faster. Advanced and special cases in variable manipulation # Indexing in lists # Accessing/modifying list elements requires providing a numeric index between the brackets, e.g. x[ 0 ] . Note variables can also be used for indexing, like x[ y ] where y is a positive integer or zero. For the below table, assume x = [ \"one\", \"two\", \"three\" ] . x[1] //\"two\" y = 1 x[y] //\"two\" x[\"1\"] //illegal x[ z[0] ] //illegal: variable expressions not allowed for indexes x[obj.property] //illegal: variable expressions not allowed for indexes Maps and dot notation # The regular \u201cdot\u201d notation is limited in the sense it is fairly static: developers have to have prior knowledge about the keys' names, in other words, about the structure of maps and nested submaps, like in person.homeAddress.postalCode . Also, there might be cases where a key name does not fit the required pattern, like in person.street-address or persona.direcci\u00f3n ; even worse, there might be cases where the actual key is only known at runtime. There are ways to overcome this: Example Notes x.\"- wow!\" Access the value associated to the key named -wow! prop = ... x.$prop Access the value associated to the key whose name is contained in the variable prop (that holds a string value). Note actual value of prop may be originated from a Java call or another form of computation propA = ... propB = ... x.$propA.c.\"d\".$propB A mix of notations is valid. For example, if x= { a: { b: 0, c: { c: true, d: { e: null, f: \"hello\" } } } } , propA is equal to \"a\" , and propB to \"f\" , the expression on the left evaluates \"hello\" Usage of .$ requires to supply a variable after the dollar sign: grouped variable expressions are not supported. Thus, it is not possible to achieve something like x.a.c.($map.mykey).f in order to obtain \"hello\" if map = { mykey: \"d\" } . Indexing in maps # For convenience, when a key name \u201clooks like\u201d a positive integer (or zero), e.g. \"2\" , \"10\" , etc., numeric values can directly be used to get/set data in a map: x = { } x.\"1\" = \"golf\" x[1] //retrieves \"golf\" x[2] = \"polo\" //adds the key/value pair \"2\" / \"polo\" Language keywords # The following is a list of reserved words and as such, cannot be used as variable names or maps keys (in literal notation).

For non-static method invocations, i.e. no hash sign, the class used for method lookup is that of the instance passed (the first parameter in the Call directive). When the instance does not hold a Java but an Agama value, the following is used to pick a class: Agama type Java class for method lookup string String boolean Boolean number Double list java.util.List map java.util.Map Once a concrete method is selected, a best effort is made to convert (if required) the values passed as arguments so that they match the expected parameter types in the method signature. If a conversion fails, this will degenerate in an IllegalArgumentException . More on conversions here . Limitations: list and map literals cannot be passed as arguments to method calls directly. This means the following is illegal: Call co.Utils#myMethod { key: [ 1, 2 , 3] } [ \"Yeeha!\" ] . To achieve the same effect assign the literal value to a variable and pass that instead Call ing a method that mutates one or more of the arguments passed will not work properly if the corresponding parameters in the method signature have type information attached. For example, copying a list into another using java.util.Collections#copy\u200b(List<? super T> dest, List<? extends T> src) may not behave as expected. Conversely, calling java.lang.reflect.Array#set\u200b(Object array, int index, Object value) works fine because array does not have a parameterized type. The practice of mutating passed arguments is unusual and sometimes discouraged in programming","title":"Highlights"},{"location":"admin/developer/agama/dsl-full/#exception-handling","text":"As seen in the examples Agama can deal with Java exceptions, however, this feature should be used sparingly. When exception handling adds undesired complexity to your code, create wrapper methods in Java and do the processing there instead of delegating that to the DSL.","title":"Exception handling"},{"location":"admin/developer/agama/dsl-full/#arguments-conversion","text":"Agama types do not match Java types. This means passing a \"native\" Agama value as parameter in a method Call requires some form of compatibility with the target (Java) type in the method signature. Earlier , we saw how some Java values returned from Call s can be treated in Agama code in a very straightforward manner, here we make an analysis in the reverse direction: from Agama to Java. An argument (Agama value) is compatible with a method parameter if it can be \"converted\" successfully. As we'll see, conversion feels pretty natural in practice. If this process fails a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException is thrown and the flow will crash unless the exception is caught. Note however the recommended practice is to let flows crash . The following lists some of the most common successful conversions: Agama value Can be converted to string String or char[] boolean Boolean or primitive equivalent number Double / Float / Integer / Long / Short / Byte or primitive equivalent null Any non-primitive list Array or class implementing Collection<T> as long as items can be converted to type T map Class implementing Map<K, V> as long as keys and values can be converted to types K and V , respectively map Java bean. Unrecognized properties in Agama value are ignored The below table shows some examples of interesting and handy conversions: Agama value Param data type in target Java method Argument value (Agama) Received param value (in method) Notes Positive number having fractional part Integer / Long / Short / Byte or primitive equivalent 2.6 2 Integer part kept Negative number having fractional part Integer / Long / Short / Byte or primitive equivalent -2.4 2 Integer part kept Integer number Float / Double or primitive equivalent 1 1.0 list of number s List<Integer> [1, 2.0, 3.1, -4.2] [1, 2, 3, -4] Only integer parts kept list of integer number s List<Float> / List<Double> [1, 2, 3, -4] [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, -4.0] string of length 1 Character or primitive equivalent a a Passing a zero, two, or more lengthed string will make the call fail When the argument is not an Agama but a Java object/primitive, the following rules apply: If the value can be cast to the target type, no conversion is needed, otherwise If it is an instance of java.lang.Number and the type is a numeric primitive or wrapper (e.g. Integer ), the value is truncated if required, otherwise The value is serialized to JSON - if possible - and then an attempt to create a Java instance based on the given JSON contents is made. For this purpose, the FasterXML Jackson library is used This is powerful because it allows to send data of similar shape/structure when data types do not necessarily match. Consider the following example: s = \"a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\" jStrArr = Call s split \" \" words = Call java.util.Collections#unmodifiableSet jStrArr This Agama snippet creates the (Java) Set of different words found in a given (Agama) string .

Introduction # Agama flows are written using a small DSL (domain specific language) designed purposedly for writing web flows. Some remarkable features of the DSL include: It helps depicting the structure of web flows in a natural way It is closer to human language than general-purpose programming languages It has a clean, concise, non-distracting syntax It has by design limited computational power forcing computations to occur in a more formal, general-purpose language like Java Intrinsic properties to highlight: It follows the imperative paradigm mainly, and makes use of a few declarative elements Execution takes place in a traditional sequential manner Flows can be treated as functions (reusable routines with well-defined inputs) It has no special constructs focused on authentication semantics: a flow simply finishes with a positive or negative result (plus optional extra data), however It provides dedicated contructs for common patterns in web flows like: \"show a page\" and \"retrieve the data user provided in that page\" \"redirect a user to an external site\" and later \"retrieve the data provided at the callback url\" It supports typical language elements like assignments, conditionals, loops, etc. Important In the process of flow writing, the DSL should be mainly used to structure a flow and collect user data while delegating more intensive tasks like querying databases, invoking web services, and so on, to Java. Language compiler # Agama is not a compiled language. Code is transpiled to an intermediate representation which is then interpreted at runtime. Developers don't need to issue special commands for transpilation to occur. This is automatically executed in the background by the engine some seconds after a flow has been added or modified. The process of checking and fixing potential syntax errors is described here . Syntactic features # Agama is case sensitive, e.g. X and x are two different things With a few exceptions, instructions always have to be written in a single line There are no parenthesis or semicolons Nesting of blocks takes place by using indented blocks Single line comments are supported. Use // to start a comment anywhere in a given line Data types, literals and variables # Agama is a dynamically typed language. Data types are not explicit in code and variables are not declared, just used. Type checks occur at runtime. Values fit into any of: string , boolean , number , list or map . Also, the \"special\" value null can be used to represent the absence of a value. The table below presents examples of literals: Type Valid literals Invalid literals string \"Agama\"; \"\"; \"Hello\\nGluu\" (line feed usage) \"\"\" boolean true; false True; yes; FALSE number 0.1; -0.1; 1; 1000; 255 .1; -.1; +1; 1e+03; 0xFF list []; [1, 2, 3]; [1, [2, 3]]; [\"Agama\", false] [1..3]; [1..] map {}; { Color: \"blue\" }, { a: { a_b: [\"foo\"] } } { _a: 2 }; { 2: 2 }; See the full reference to learn more about literals. A variable is global in the flow where it is being used. Examples of valid variable names are: x , mom , Yes , A_ha , B52 . The following are invalid: 4 , \"red\" , _oh , A-ha . Variables can be assigned a value several times in the same flow. Examples of valid assignments: x = 0 , mom = \"love\" , Yes = true , A_ha = [ 2.718, 3.141 ] , B52 = { rock: \"lobster\" } Depending on the data type of a variable, its underlying value(s) can be accessed or modified in a variety of ways. As shown in the table bellow Agama feels pretty natural: Sample assignment Access/Mutation example Result x = \"Hi\" x[0] \"H\" x = \"Hi\" x.length 2 x = \"Hi\" x[1] = \"o\" Strings are immutable x = [1, 2, 3] x[1] 2 x = [1, 2, 3] x[3] null x = [1, 2, 3] x[0] = \"zero\" [\"zero\", 2, 3] x = [1, 2, 3] x.length = 5 [\"zero\", 2, 3, null, null] x = { a: true } x.a true x = { a: true } x.b null x = { a: true } x.c = false { a: true, c: false } A variable whose value is the product of a Java call can be accessed and manipulated as described here . See the full reference to learn more about accessing and mutating data in variables. Flow structure # A flow consists of a header and one or more statements following. The header starts with the Flow keyword followed by the qualified name of the flow, e.g. Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey . Next, in an indented block several aspects can be provided (in this specific order): The base directory to use for this flow's assets Flow timeout A variable to hold flow configurations Variables to receive flow inputs Except for the base directory, all of these are optional. The following is an example of a flow header, where the folder mydir should hold the assets of the flow (more info on assets here ). The flow may receive three parameters: salutation , askGender , and promptRealName from their callers (when used as subflow ) or from the authentication request when the flow is launched directly from a web browser. Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Inputs salutation askGender promptRealName The statements that make up the flow (body) come after the header and start at column 1, ie. aligned with the Flow keyword: Flow com.acme.FoodSurvey Basepath \"mydir\" Inputs salutation askGender promptRealName x = \"Hi\" y = false ... See the full reference to learn more about flow structure. Logging # With the Log instruction data can be sent to the flows log. Check the logging page for more details. Some illustrative examples follow: Code Message appended Notes Log \"Hi there\" Hi there Log \"Hello\" \"world\" 0 false Hello world 0 false Log can be passed a variable number of parameters Log [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 1, 2, 3, ...more Lists and maps are not traversed wholly Log \"Hell%% 0 %\" \"o\" \" world\" false Hello world 0 false Placeholders usage Log \"@warn Today is Friday %th\" 13 Today is Friday 13th Message logged as warning By default messages are logged at the INFO level. This can be customized as in the last row. Conditionals and branching # When and Otherwise allow to write conditionals. With and , or , is and is not , logical (boolean) expressions can be built. Examples: car = { brand: \"Ford\", color: null, model: 1963 } When car.color is null car.color = \"pink\" ... Nested conditionals: ... When car.color is \"pink\" When car.brand is \"Ford\" Log \"Weird-looking car\" ... Use of Otherwise : ... When car.color is not null Log \"you have a regular painted car\" ... Otherwise ... Notes: Equality is designed to work with null , numbers, strings, and boolean values only. More exactly, a number should only be compared to a number, a string to a string, etc., otherwise the equality test evaluates to false. Comparisons are limited to equality ( is ) or inequality ( is not ). For other forms of comparison you can resort to Java. Agama also has Match ... to , a construct similar to C/Java switch . See the full reference to learn more about conditionals and branching. Flow finish # Finish is used to terminate a flow's execution. In general, a flow can finish successfully or failed. Examples: Code Meaning it = { success: true, data: { userId: \"as9233Qz\", ... }} Finish it Flow finished successfully. Some relevant data attached it = { success: false, error: \"User entered a wrong password 3 times\" } Finish it Flow failed. Error description attached Finish \"as9233Qz\" Shorthand for { success: true, data: { userId: \"as9233Qz\" } } See the full reference to learn more about flows termination. Web interaction # RFAC # The RFAC (Redirect and Fetch at callback) instruction abstracts the process of redirecting the user's browser to an external site and collect the data presented later at a designated callback URL. Important Agama engine's callback URL is https://<your-server>/jans-auth/fl/callback . Example: result = RFAC \"https://login.twitter.com/?blah..&boo=...\" This redirects to the given URL by issuing an HTTP redirect (\"302 Found\"). Once the user browser is taken to the callback by the external site (e.g. twitter.com), the data included in the query string or payload is stored in result (a map ) for further processing. See the full reference to learn more. RRF # The RRF (Render-Reply-Fetch) instruction expresses the concept of \"show a page and grab user data after interaction\". It takes the path to a template and injects a value into it. The produced ( R endered) markup is sent ( R eplied) to the browser and finally, the result of the interaction of the user with the page can be retrieved ( F etched). Example Details RRF \"survey.ftl\" Renders the template survey.ftl (located in this flow's base path) and resulting markup is replied to user's browser. Data submitted by the user is ignored obj = { salutation: \"Hey!\", ... } result = RRF \"survey.ftl\" obj Renders the template survey.ftl by injecting the data passed in obj and the resulting markup is replied to user's browser. Data submitted by the user is stored in variable result : a map whose keys are named according to the form fields present in survey.ftl Notes: The template location must be specified with a string literal only (not variables) RRF has more capabilities. See the full reference to learn more. Looping # Repeat # Repeat was designed with the concept of attempts/retries in mind: a set of statements are executed, a condition can optionally be supplied in order to abort the loop early, and (optionally too) a block of statements can be executed before the next iteration is started if the condition evaluated to false . Example: x = ... // an integer value month = \"...\" obj = { error: null } y = Repeat x times max data = RRF \"guess_birthday_month.ftl\" obj Quit When data.guess is month obj.error = \"Wrong! try again\" This loop runs x iterations at most. At every iteration the template guess_birthday_month.ftl is RRF'ed. If the value provided at the browser matches that of month variable the loop is aborted earlier, otherwise an error message is set - and template may potentially use it. After the loop finishes, variable y will contain the total number of iterations made to completion. This excludes partial iterations aborted by Quit . Notes: - Quit and the statements following are optional - The variable assignment before the Repeat keyword is optional - See the full reference to learn more about Repeat Iterate over # Iterate over is used to traverse the items of a string, list, or the keys of a map. At every iteration, a variable is set with the current item or key name. As with Repeat , a loop may be aborted earlier, an optional block of statements can be specified after Quit , and the total number of iterations can be stored in a variable. Example: seasons = [ \"spring\", \"winter\", \"fall\", \"summer\" ] sports = [ \"soccer,\" \"golf\", \"tenis\" ] Iterate over seasons using sn y = Iterate over sports using sport Log \"Shall we play % in % ?\" sport sn Quit When sn is \"winter\" Log \"yes!\" Log \"We played % sports in %\" y sn The above features loop nesting. The outer loop iterates over seasons list and the inner one over sports . The variables sn and sport hold the current visited element. The inner loop is aborted upon a given condition. The total number of complete iterations is recorded in y every time the inner loop finishes. See the full reference to learn more about Iterate over . Subflows # A flow can Trigger another flow (a.k.a subflow) and grab its response when Finish ed. This feature materializes flow composition and re-use in Agama. Example: outcome = Trigger jo.jo.PersonalInfoGathering null false Log \"subflow returned with success?\" outcome.success The above starts the flow identified by jo.jo.PersonalInfoGathering passing the given parameters (assuming it receives two inputs). When done, outcome will reference the map that was employed to Finish the subflow, in other words, its response. See the full reference to learn more about Trigger . Java interaction # Agama interfaces seemlessly with Java or Groovy by means of the Call instruction. Recall the DSL is designed to force developers use Java when the task at hand cannot be implemented by simple data manipulation or comparison of values. This way a flow written in Agama DSL serves fundamentally as a depiction of the flow itself, hiding most of the internal details and low-level computations. See the full reference to learn more about Call .","title":"DSL Guide"},{"location":"admin/developer/agama/dsl/#agama-dsl","text":"Note This document presents a view of the most relevant aspects and constructs of the language.

If the value provided at the browser matches that of month variable the loop is aborted earlier, otherwise an error message is set - and template may potentially use it.

Is Javascript supported? # Yes, the template engine is not concerned about the kind of contents linked in markup. It does not even care if your markup makes any sense. For FreeMarker, templates just produce a textual output.

About Agama engine # Does it support AJAX? # If you require a flow with no page refreshes, it could be implemented using AJAX calls as long as they align to the POST-REDIRECT-GET pattern, where a form is submitted, and as response a 302/303 HTTP redirection is obtained. Your Javascript code must also render UI elements in accordance with the data obtained by following the redirect (GET). Also, care must be taken in order to process server errors, timeouts, etc. In general, this requires a considerable amount of effort. If you require AJAX to consume a resource (service) residing in the same domain of your server, there is no restriction - the engine is not involved.

Miscellaneous # Does flow execution timeout? # Yes. The maximum amount of time an end-user can take to fully complete a flow is driven by the configuration of the authentication server and can be constrained even more in the flow itself. Read about timeouts here . How to prevent launching a flow directly from the browser? # Disable the flow. It will still be callable from other flows.

From a programming perspective, a flow is a lot like a function or subroutine in a regular program. Once a flow is triggered, it is executed from top to bottom until a Finish statement is encountered. There are no asynchronous calls, threads, event listeners or callbacks to deal with. There are no requirements on flow initialization or flow structure either. The RRF construct makes code look totally fluid despite there is a \"pause\" once the response (markup) is sent. When this occurs there is no server-side processing taking place at all. Only after the user submits data to the server the flow is \"resumed\" and execution continues. With RFAC a similar pause happens except resumption is triggered by means of a browser redirect. The above makes the lifecycle of a flow very simple: after triggered, it advances and terminates when it is finished , aborted , or times out . Flow advance and navigation # Once a web page (or a response in general) is replied to a web client (browser), a POST is required to make the flow proceed, see RRF . The POST is expected to be sent to the current URL only, otherwise, a 404 error will be thrown. The engine will then respond with a redirect (usually 301) so the client will GET the next URL to be rendered. This pattern of navigation is known as \"POST-REDIRECT-GET\". There is a clear correspondence of the \"current URL\" with the physical path of the template rendered. As an example, if the browser location shows https://<your-host>/jans-auth/fl/foo/bar.fls , the involved template is stored at /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl/foo and has name bar . This makes flows more predictable and easier to reason about. Note however URLs are not manipulable: an attempt to set the browser location to a URL corresponding to a different template will not make that template be rendered or provoke any unexpected jump in the flow control. Instead, an error page is shown that allows users to re-take where they left off or to restart from scratch. In other words, navigation honors the \"current flow URL\" avoiding attempts to re-visit past stages or make unexpected moves to future ones. Additionally, the engine by default sends responses with proper HTTP headers so page contents are not cached. This is key to prevent manipulation and allows a safe usage of the browser's back button, where it will not be possible to visit past stages. Finishing flows # Carefully decide how use the Finish directive in a flow. Specially when terminating sucessfully, many times developers would like to attach the identity of the user in question, as in Finish userId . This results in a successful authentication event and makes sense, but this is not always desired. Sometimes due to decomposition practices (in order to favor re-use and better organization), small flows can arise that should not carry the user identifier. As an example, suppose several flows exist for OTP (one-time passcode) authentication, like SMS, e-mail, token-based, etc. These would receive the user identifier as an input and act accordingly by verifying the passcode the user has entered at the browser. A parent flow can be used to prompt for a username and password first, and then forward the user to the OTP flow that better matches the user's preferences. This sounds fine, however, since any enabled flow can be triggered by means of an authentication request, a skilled individual might try to launch one of the OTP flows directly passing proper parameters. This would result in authentications using a single factor (i.e. no password) which is undesirable. Thus, it is recommended to include userId in Finish only when there is a reason to do so, that is, when the authentication carried out by the flow is strong enough. This largely depends on the defined organization policies, but using a two-factor authentication is often a good sign of strength. Another approach is disabling flows that should not be triggered from a browser directly. Disabled flows can still be used as subflows from other flows. Recall the simplest way to express a positive authentication outcome is just Finish true . Cancellation # This is a feature that in conjuction with template overrides allows developers to implement backtracking or alternative routing. Suppose a flow is designed to reuse two or more existing subflows. As expected these subflows are neither aware of each other nor of its parent. How can the parent make so that once the user has landed at a page belonging to a given subflow A be presented the alternative to take another route, say, to subflow B? Clearly a page at flow A can be overriden, however, how to abort A and make it jump to B? The answer is cancellation. Through flow cancellation, a running flow can be aborted and the control returned to one of its parents for further processing. This can achieved by overriding a template so that the POST to the current URL includes a form field named _abort . POSTing this way will provoke the associated Trigger call to return a value like { aborted: true, data: ... } where data is a map consisting of the payload (form fields) sent with the POST. Thus, developers can build custom pages and add for example a button to provoke the cancellation. Then, back in the flow implementation take the user to the desired path. As an example, suppose there exists two flows that allow users to enter and validate a one-time passcode (OTP), one flow sends the OTP via e-mail while the other through an SMS. Assume these flows receive a user identifier as input and render a single UI page each to enter the received OTP. If we are interested in building a flow that prompts for username/password credentials and use the SMS-based OTP flow with a customization that consists of showing a link like \"Didn't get an SMS?, send the passcode to my e-mail\", the following is a sketch of an implementation: ... //validate username/password ... result = Trigger co.acme.SmsOTP userId Override templates \"path/to/enter_otp.ftlh\" \"cust_enter_otp.ftlh\" When result.aborted is true //The user clicked on \"send the passcode to my e-mail\" result = Trigger co.acme.EmailOTP userId When result.success is true result.data = { userId: userId } Finish result The overriden template cust_enter_otp.ftlh would have a form like: ... <form method=\"post\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"> <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-link\" id=\"_abort\" name=\"_abort\" value=\"\"> Didn't get an SMS?, send the passcode to my e-mail</button> </form> Ideas for a good experience: SmsOTP and EmailOTP should account for retries in their implementation, e.g. give the user 2-3 opportunities to enter an OTP. This can be parameterized, for instance. These flows should not contain data: { userId: ... } when they finish successfully. If any of them are used standalone - not as subflows - the result will be a successful authentication for the given user. This means someone can have access to the protected resource (e.g. target application) with just entering a valid OTP and knowledge a valid user identifier. This is often weak in terms of security. An extra authentication factor should be required, like a password as in the example above Cancellation bubble-up # In order to override a page, the path to the corresponding template can be easily derived from the URL seen at the browser's address bar when the subflow is Trigger ed. Note the page may not necessarily belong directly to the subflow triggered but probably to another flow lying deep in a chain of Trigger invocations. As an example suppose you are interested in building a flow A that reuses flow B. You identify a page shown that needs to be overriden. It might happen this page is actually rendered by C - a flow that B in turn reuses. In scenarios like this cancellation still works transparently and developers need not be aware of flows dependencies. In practice, when cancellation occurs at A, it bubbles up to B and then to C, which is the target of this process. Note that even flow B (as is) may also be overriding A's templates. Resolution of a template path takes place from the inner to the outer flow, so it occurs this way in the example: path is as found in A's RRF instruction path is looked up on the list provided in B's Override templates . If a match is found, path is updated accordingly path is looked up on the list provided in C's Override templates . If a match is found, path is updated accordingly The page referenced by path is rendered When a page POSTs a cancellation as described earlier, the flow to return control to is determined by the path of the template that issued the given POST. Similarly a lookup on B's Override templates takes place followed by other on A's. Timeouts # Authentication flows are normally short-lived. They usually span no more than a few minutes. In Agama, the maximum amount of time an end-user can take to fully complete a flow is driven by the configuration of the authentication server , specifically the sessionIdUnauthenticatedUnusedLifetime property which is measured in seconds. As an example, if this value is 120, any attempt to authenticate taking more than two minutes will throw an error page. Moreover, a flow may specify its own timeout in the header . In practice, the effective timeout is the smallest value between sessionIdUnauthenticatedUnusedLifetime and the value supplied in the header, if any. Depending on specific needs, sessionIdUnauthenticatedUnusedLifetime may have to be set to a higher value than the server's default. This may be the case where flows send e-mail notifications with temporary codes.","title":"Flows Lifecycle"},{"location":"admin/developer/agama/flows-lifecycle/#flows-lifecycle","text":"Important The reader is supposed to have checked the DSL basics before proceeding with this page. From a programming perspective, a flow is a lot like a function or subroutine in a regular program. Once a flow is triggered, it is executed from top to bottom until a Finish statement is encountered. There are no asynchronous calls, threads, event listeners or callbacks to deal with. There are no requirements on flow initialization or flow structure either. The RRF construct makes code look totally fluid despite there is a \"pause\" once the response (markup) is sent. When this occurs there is no server-side processing taking place at all. Only after the user submits data to the server the flow is \"resumed\" and execution continues. With RFAC a similar pause happens except resumption is triggered by means of a browser redirect. The above makes the lifecycle of a flow very simple: after triggered, it advances and terminates when it is finished , aborted , or times out .","title":"Flows lifecycle"},{"location":"admin/developer/agama/flows-lifecycle/#flow-advance-and-navigation","text":"Once a web page (or a response in general) is replied to a web client (browser), a POST is required to make the flow proceed, see RRF . The POST is expected to be sent to the current URL only, otherwise, a 404 error will be thrown. The engine will then respond with a redirect (usually 301) so the client will GET the next URL to be rendered. This pattern of navigation is known as \"POST-REDIRECT-GET\". There is a clear correspondence of the \"current URL\" with the physical path of the template rendered. As an example, if the browser location shows https://<your-host>/jans-auth/fl/foo/bar.fls , the involved template is stored at /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl/foo and has name bar . This makes flows more predictable and easier to reason about. Note however URLs are not manipulable: an attempt to set the browser location to a URL corresponding to a different template will not make that template be rendered or provoke any unexpected jump in the flow control. Instead, an error page is shown that allows users to re-take where they left off or to restart from scratch. In other words, navigation honors the \"current flow URL\" avoiding attempts to re-visit past stages or make unexpected moves to future ones. Additionally, the engine by default sends responses with proper HTTP headers so page contents are not cached. This is key to prevent manipulation and allows a safe usage of the browser's back button, where it will not be possible to visit past stages.","title":"Flow advance and navigation"},{"location":"admin/developer/agama/flows-lifecycle/#finishing-flows","text":"Carefully decide how use the Finish directive in a flow. Specially when terminating sucessfully, many times developers would like to attach the identity of the user in question, as in Finish userId . This results in a successful authentication event and makes sense, but this is not always desired. Sometimes due to decomposition practices (in order to favor re-use and better organization), small flows can arise that should not carry the user identifier. As an example, suppose several flows exist for OTP (one-time passcode) authentication, like SMS, e-mail, token-based, etc. These would receive the user identifier as an input and act accordingly by verifying the passcode the user has entered at the browser. A parent flow can be used to prompt for a username and password first, and then forward the user to the OTP flow that better matches the user's preferences. This sounds fine, however, since any enabled flow can be triggered by means of an authentication request, a skilled individual might try to launch one of the OTP flows directly passing proper parameters. This would result in authentications using a single factor (i.e. no password) which is undesirable. Thus, it is recommended to include userId in Finish only when there is a reason to do so, that is, when the authentication carried out by the flow is strong enough. This largely depends on the defined organization policies, but using a two-factor authentication is often a good sign of strength. Another approach is disabling flows that should not be triggered from a browser directly. Disabled flows can still be used as subflows from other flows. Recall the simplest way to express a positive authentication outcome is just Finish true .","title":"Finishing flows"},{"location":"admin/developer/agama/flows-lifecycle/#cancellation","text":"This is a feature that in conjuction with template overrides allows developers to implement backtracking or alternative routing. Suppose a flow is designed to reuse two or more existing subflows. As expected these subflows are neither aware of each other nor of its parent. How can the parent make so that once the user has landed at a page belonging to a given subflow A be presented the alternative to take another route, say, to subflow B? Clearly a page at flow A can be overriden, however, how to abort A and make it jump to B? The answer is cancellation. Through flow cancellation, a running flow can be aborted and the control returned to one of its parents for further processing. This can achieved by overriding a template so that the POST to the current URL includes a form field named _abort . POSTing this way will provoke the associated Trigger call to return a value like { aborted: true, data: ... } where data is a map consisting of the payload (form fields) sent with the POST. Thus, developers can build custom pages and add for example a button to provoke the cancellation. Then, back in the flow implementation take the user to the desired path. As an example, suppose there exists two flows that allow users to enter and validate a one-time passcode (OTP), one flow sends the OTP via e-mail while the other through an SMS.

In short, the following are the steps required to build a flow: Design and code the flow Add the flow to the server Upload flow assets (templates, images, Java libs and classes, etc.) Trigger an authentication request Apply flow updates As usual, several iterations will take place until you get it right. Note Throughout this document it is assumed you have a standard single-VM Janssen installation Design and code # It is up to developers how to design. This will normally require identifying the several \"steps\" that make up a flow and the conditions upon which \"branching\" takes place. Also it is important to check already existing flows in the server that may be reused for the purpose. Agama DSL was made to structure flows only, not for doing general purpose programming. This means developers have to use Java for doing low-level computations. This way, the resulting implementation (in DSL) serves as a depiction of the flow itself, hiding most of the internal details. Knowledge of the DSL is a requirement as consequence of the above. Fortunately Agama is small and very easy to learn. Check the DSL basics here . Also the \"Hello World\" sample flow will give you a first impresssion on the language. Currently there are no IDE/editor plugins for coding in Agama available. We hope to deliver tools in the future to ease the development experience. About crashes # As a flow executes things can go wrong for reasons that developers cannot foresee. A database may have crashed, a connection to an external system may have failed, the flow engine may have some bug, etc. When an abnormal situation is presented, a flow simply crashes. If a flow crashes, its parent flows (or flow) if they exist, crash as well. Trying to handle crashes involves a lot of planning and work which is too costly and will unlikely account for the so many things that might fail in a real setting. Thus, coding defensively is not recommended. While in Agama is possible to deal with Java exceptions, that feature should be used sparingly. Creating a flow # In order to manage flows, developers interact with a small REST API. Click here to learn about the requisites to access this API and here to check the respective open API definition - locate the endpoints starting with /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama . There are two ways available to add a flow: Endpoint Payload's content type Method Description /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/{qname} text/plain POST Creates a flow with the supplied qualified name ( qname ) and source code passed in the payload /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama application/json POST Creates a flow with the data supplied in the payload Notes: Ensure the tokens used have scope https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.write The response of a successful operation returns a 201 status code (i.e. created) and a JSON representation of the created flow - source code not included. If some fields result unfamiliar to you, consult the swagger (open api) document linked above A 400 response (i.e. bad request) is generally obtained when the input source code has syntax problems Examples: Creates a flow named com.acme.myflow using as source the data stored in file flow.txt curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' --data-binary @flow.txt https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/com.acme.myflow Creates a flow based on the data stored in file flow.js curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d@flow.js https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama where flow.js might look like this: { \"qname\": \"com.acme.myflow\", \"source\": \"Flow com.acme.myflow\\n\\tBasepath \\\"\\\"\\n\\nin = { name: \\\"John\\\" }\\nRRF \\\"index.ftlh\\\" in\\n\\nFinish \\\"john_doe\\\"\", \"enabled\": true } Notes: Only qname and source are required in the JSON payload If enabled is absent, a false value is used by default in the JSON-based endpoint. The text-based version always assumes true . This property allows or prevents launching a flow directly from the browser Upload required assets # Note For convenience, references to the directory /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama will be replaced by <AGAMA-DIR> here onwards. The Basepath directive determines where flow assets reside. Ensure to create the given directory under <AGAMA-DIR>/ftl . Probably the same has to be done under <AGAMA-DIR>/fl . The difference between ftl and fl is subtle but important: the former directory must hold Freemarker templates while the latter assets like stylesheets, images and javascript code. This separation avoids Jetty server to expose the raw source code of your templates whose corresponding URL would be quite easy to guess. As an example, suppose your Basepath is foo and you have the instructions RRF index.ftlh and RRF bar/index2.ftlh somewhere in your code. Then your local <AGAMA-DIR>/ftl should look like: foo |- index.ftlh +- bar \\- index2.ftlh Say index.ftlh has markup like <img src=\"bar/me.png\"> and index2.ftlh has <link href=\"my/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> somewhere.

Flow updates # Important Ensure you have read about the requisites to access the REST API You may like to make modifications and enhancements to your flow. There are two ways to do so: Endpoint Payload's content type Method Description /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/source/{qname} text/plain PUT Updates the source code of the flow identified by the given qualified name ( qname ) with the value passed in the payload /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/{qname} application/json-patch+json PATCH Modifies the flow identified by the given qualified name ( qname ) using the JSON patch provided in the payload. See RFC 6902 Notes: Ensure the tokens used have scope https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.write Altering the source code of a flow via PATCH is possible but requires transforming the code into a (one liner) JSON string; this will be a repetitive burden. The PUT version is clearly more straightforward. If you still want to use PATCH, ensure to also modify the integer property revision increasing it by one. This will ensure the source changes are effectively picked. The response of a successful operation returns a 200 status code and a JSON representation of the updated flow - source code not included A 400 response (i.e. bad request) is generally obtained if the supplied source code was has syntax problems Examples: Modifies the flow com.acme.myflow replacing its source with the data stored in file flow.txt curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -X PUT --data-binary @flow.txt https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/source/com.acme.myflow Applies a series of modifications to the flow com.acme.myflow : nullifies its description, sets the value of configuration properties, and modifies the creation timestamp to Aug 8th 23:06:40 UTC curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json-patch+json' -X PATCH -d@patch.js https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/com.acme.myflow where patch.js contents are: [ { \"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/metadata/description\" }, { \"op\":\"replace\", \"path\": \"/metadata/properties\", \"value\": { \"string_key1\": \"value_1\", \"number_key2\": 10 } }, { \"op\":\"replace\", \"path\": \"/metadata/timestamp\", \"value\": 1660000000000 } ] Flow retrieval and removal # Important Ensure you have read about the requisites to access the REST API There are two endpoints for retrieval: Endpoint Method Description /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama GET Retrieves all flows' data /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/{qname} GET Retrieves the data of the flow identified by the given qualified name ( qname ) Notes: Ensure the tokens used have scope https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.readonly The response of a successful operation returns a 200 status code with a JSON representation of the flow(s).

By design Agama is a transpiled language and transpilation occurs in the background - in the form of a timer task. This task involves processes that go beyond the checks applied upon flow creation or update. When an error is detected at transpilation time, two things can occur: If this was the first transpilation attempt, i.e. it's a recently created flow, a message like \"Source code has errors\" will appear in the browser when launching the flow Otherwise, no error is shown and the flow will behave as if no changes had been applied to the flow's code.

This means developers have to use Java for doing low-level computations. This way, the resulting implementation (in DSL) serves as a depiction of the flow itself, hiding most of the internal details. Knowledge of the DSL is a requirement as consequence of the above. Fortunately Agama is small and very easy to learn. Check the DSL basics here .

Here, set property enabled to true and increase revision value by one Set enabled property in Agama configuration to true . This is located in the agamaConfiguration section of the auth server configuration Flow data # Every flow has some associated information. At minimum this is required: Qualified name: The flow identifer. This is normally expressed using an Internet domain reverse notation, e.g. co.acme.SmsOTP Source code: The flow implementation using Agama DSL Optional details include: Enabled status: Determines if the flow can be launched directly from a web browser Display name: A short descriptive name of the flow intended for humans, e.g. \"passwordless authentication\" Description Flow author Properties: A JSON document often used to supply configuration parameters More on how to supply this data later. Assets # These are elements used to build the user interface such as templates, images, stylesheets, and javascript code. Templates are written using FreeMarker Template Language (FTL). This is a simple and highly productive language to produce HTML and other forms of output. By convention templates generating HTML markup in Agama have the extension ftlh . In Agama, templates must reside in the filesystem under /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl directory. All other assets (CSS, JS, etc.) are expected to be under /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/fl . Later we'll see a flow can designate a given directory for its assets, thus, such directory must be created at both places (inside ftl and fl folders). Java classes # Agama DSL supports calling Java code - it is designed to force developers use Java when tasks cannot be implemented by simple data manipulation or comparison of values. Any public class or interface in the classpath of jans-auth webapp can be used for this purpose. Additionally the classpath can be augmented by uploaded source files on the fly. Click here to learn more. Client application # This is the target application that end-users will get access to after a successful authentication. In OpenId Connect terms, a \"Relying Party\" or RP. It is advisable to have this application ready before proceeding to the next section of this document. Depending on the tools and acquaintance with OpenId Connect protocol, this may take some time for developers. Note it may also require to apply configurations in the (Janssen) server for this purpose. A low resistance path we recommend is trying the stripped down Javascript client example by Nat Sakimura. Here, the discovery URL is your server's URL. Another alternative is trying mod_auth_openidc , an Apache 2 server module that implements RP functionality. Hello world sample flow # Your first taste of Agama will be through a dummy \"hello world\" flow. Here, the end-user will be presented a salutation page with a submit button which once pressed, will finish the process. For the sake of simplicity, the user to be authenticated will be a hardcoded one. This way we avoid gathering data at the browser and any other further processing in order to keep the example as short and simple as possible. Note While in most cases flows need to externally \"receive\" data and configuration parameters to properly drive their behavior, this is not the case here. The flow will only show a static salutation message and will terminate logging in a certain user, if existing. Flow code # The source code (written in agama DSL dialect) is shown below. Note the absence of parenthesis and semicolons - in general the syntax is very lightweight. A line-by-line description follows: Line 2: every flow starts with the Flow keyword followed by a qualified name (think of it as the flow identifier) Line 3: Basepath specifies the directory where the assets of this flow reside. Note this is part of an indented block. There are more directives that may go here but they are beyond scope right now. Basepath is always mandatory. Line 4: empty. There can be any number of empty lines in a source file Line 5: an assignment to a variable. Agama is dynamically typed and variables are not declared. Here in is a map (a collection of key/value pairs). Note its resemblance to JSON. in has no special meaning, we could have used x , Soup , or whatever_123 . Line 6: RRF is used to send a response to the user's browser: it takes the path to a template ( hello/index.ftlh ) and injects a value into it ( in in this case). The produced ( R endered) markup is sent ( R eplied) to the browser. Finally, the result of the interaction of the user with the page can be retrieved ( F etched), however, this is skipped here because we are no capturing anything at the client side. The contents of index.ftlh should be familiar to web developers. The ${...} notation is used to dynamically insert values in the markup: the text John in this case. Expressions like this are integral part of Freemarker. Once form submission occurs, flow execution continues at line 8. Line 8: a logging statement. This appends the text Done! to the flow's log. The Log instruction is pretty versatile; it is used in its simplest form here. Line 9: marks the flow ending. Finish has several forms but here a shorthand notation is used where we always report a positive success and supply the identifier of a user. If it turns out your local user database contains a user identified by john_doe , this will be the subject that will get authenticated by the server, otherwise an error page will be shown. This flow is extremely static and unrealistic but showcases minimal key elements for flow building. Please do not try this flow in any of your production servers. Getting an access token # In order to add/modify flows, you will interact with a small REST API which is protected by bearer token. To be able to get tokens, SSH to your server and perform the following steps: Run python3 /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py In the menu enter to OAuth > OIDC clients > Get list of clients Accept the default parameters, for pattern enter config Follow the instructions (in a web browser) to get authorized access A list of results will be shown, pick the value in the inum column for the client with display name Jans Config Api Client Choose back , and enter to Get client by inum Enter the collected inum and grab the value of clientSecret in the resulting JSON document Finally, choose logout and quit The collected secret is encoded, run python3 /opt/jans/bin/encode.py -D <clientSecret> to decode it. The following is an example of how to get a token using curl . Replace data in the placeholders appropriately: curl -u '<client-inum:client-secret-decoded>' -d scope='https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.write' -d grant_type=client_credentials https://<your-host>/jans-auth/restv1/token You can extract the token from the (JSON) response obtained which is a self-explanatory. Add the -k switch if your server uses a self-signed certificate. Tokens are required to have the right scopes depending on the operation to invoke, the following table summarizes this aspect: scope permission allowed https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.readonly Retrieve flow data https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.write Create or modify a flow https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.delete Remove a flow You can find here the open API definition of the REST API - locate the endpoints starting with /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama . Notes : Tokens have expiration time measured in seconds. When expired, you'll have to re-request To get a token with more than one scope, supply the required scopes separated by whitespace in the scope parameter of the request above You don't have to necessarily use the jans-config-api client to get your tokens. Any client, including one registered yourself can be used here as long as it can provide the needed scopes Add the flow to the server # The easiest way to create a flow is issuing a POST passing the source code in the payload. For our example, if the flow's source code resides in a file named flow.txt , the request would look this way: curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' --data-binary @flow.txt https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/test (the -i switch is useful to check the HTTP headers sent with the response). Notes: test (the qualified named) was supplied as the last component of the URL to send the POST to The expected status code of the response is 201 (i.e. created) unless there was some problem to process the request. Particularly, if 401 (unauthorized) was obtained, it means your token is no longer valid A successful response contains a summary (in JSON format) of the flow created If we had to modify the code of this flow, a similar operation could be used: curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -X PUT --data-binary @flow.txt https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/source/test /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/source is a dedicated endpoint that replaces a flow's code whose name is supplied in the end of the URL. If things went wrong and you want to start all over again, you can easily remove the flow like this (ensuring the token has the right scope): curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -X DELETE https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/test The status code of a successful removal is 204 (empty). To retrieve the flow's data, a request like the below can be used: curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/test Note the source code is not part of the response by default. Append ?includeSource=true to the URL for the source to be included. Important There are different, more detailed ways to retrieve, create and update flows but they are regarded in the Development lifecycle doc page. Finally the flow assets must be uploaded. You can SFTP/SCP or use other means to do so. In our example, only two steps are required: Create a directory hello under /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl Upload the template there Craft an authentication request # This section assumes your client application is ready, or at least you have made the configurations required so that you can trigger an (OpendId Connect) authentication request. This usually boils down to create and launch a URL looking like https://<your-host>/jans-auth/restv1/authorize?acr_values=agama&agama_flow=flow-qname&scope=...&response_type=...&redirect_uri=https...&client_id=...&state=... . You may like to check the spec for more details, however, keep in mind that: To trigger an Agama flow, the acr_values parameter must be equal to agama The qualified name (identifier) of the flow to trigger is passed using the parameter referenced in property cust_param_name of the Agama bridge script. agama_flow will work in most cases since this is the default value employed by the Jans installer. For the current example agama_flow=test should be fine Note To use a different parameter name ensure to register the given parameter in the server configuration (property authorizationRequestCustomAllowedParameters ) and update the bridge accordingly If the flow to call receives input parameters, their values can be passed in the custom parameter as well. Use a hyphen to separate the flow name and the parameters expressed in JSON object format. For example, if the flow had inputs height and color , you can use test-{\"height\": 190, \"color\": \"blue\"} for the value of agama_flow . Ensure to apply proper URL-encoding beforehand. In this case, the actual value would be test-%7B%22height%22%3A+190%2C+%22color%22%3A+%22blue%22%7D . If certain inputs are not provided, null values will be assigned for them Testing # Launch the authentication request in a web browser - preferably in a private window, a.k.a. incognito.

Feel free to edit index.ftlh and re-upload - templates changes are picked up immediately. Now pick an existing username from your user base and alter the flow's code so that such user gets authenticated. Edit line 9 for this purpose, for example, Finish \"admin\" . If things went fine, after the form submission your browser should have been taken to the redirect_uri defined for the authentication request.

To be able to get tokens, SSH to your server and perform the following steps: Run python3 /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py In the menu enter to OAuth > OIDC clients > Get list of clients Accept the default parameters, for pattern enter config Follow the instructions (in a web browser) to get authorized access A list of results will be shown, pick the value in the inum column for the client with display name Jans Config Api Client Choose back , and enter to Get client by inum Enter the collected inum and grab the value of clientSecret in the resulting JSON document Finally, choose logout and quit The collected secret is encoded, run python3 /opt/jans/bin/encode.py -D <clientSecret> to decode it. The following is an example of how to get a token using curl . Replace data in the placeholders appropriately: curl -u '<client-inum:client-secret-decoded>' -d scope='https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.write' -d grant_type=client_credentials https://<your-host>/jans-auth/restv1/token You can extract the token from the (JSON) response obtained which is a self-explanatory. Add the -k switch if your server uses a self-signed certificate. Tokens are required to have the right scopes depending on the operation to invoke, the following table summarizes this aspect: scope permission allowed https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.readonly Retrieve flow data https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.write Create or modify a flow https://jans.io/oauth/config/agama.delete Remove a flow You can find here the open API definition of the REST API - locate the endpoints starting with /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama . Notes : Tokens have expiration time measured in seconds. When expired, you'll have to re-request To get a token with more than one scope, supply the required scopes separated by whitespace in the scope parameter of the request above You don't have to necessarily use the jans-config-api client to get your tokens.

Notes: test (the qualified named) was supplied as the last component of the URL to send the POST to The expected status code of the response is 201 (i.e. created) unless there was some problem to process the request. Particularly, if 401 (unauthorized) was obtained, it means your token is no longer valid A successful response contains a summary (in JSON format) of the flow created If we had to modify the code of this flow, a similar operation could be used: curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -X PUT --data-binary @flow.txt https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/source/test /jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/source is a dedicated endpoint that replaces a flow's code whose name is supplied in the end of the URL. If things went wrong and you want to start all over again, you can easily remove the flow like this (ensuring the token has the right scope): curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -X DELETE https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/test The status code of a successful removal is 204 (empty). To retrieve the flow's data, a request like the below can be used: curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/test Note the source code is not part of the response by default.

Use a hyphen to separate the flow name and the parameters expressed in JSON object format. For example, if the flow had inputs height and color , you can use test-{\"height\": 190, \"color\": \"blue\"} for the value of agama_flow . Ensure to apply proper URL-encoding beforehand.

If execution reaches this point, it means the form was submitted three times and no matching code was entered. In this case, flow is finished accordingly (failed) UI template # otp.ftlh is on the same lines of the template used in the basic authentication flow. Here the form has three relevant elements: A textfield to enter the passcode (around line 35) A standard submission button (around line 41) A button with type=submit and id=resend rendered as a hypertext link (around line 47). Only when the link is clicked, resend parameter will be part of the request sent to the server If the user presses the enter key when the focus is on the text field, the form is submitted by means of the standard submission button. Combined registration and authentication flow # In this flow features like template overrides and flow cancellation are leveraged to bring a more sophisticated authentication journey. A description follows: A login form (username/password) is shown with an auxiliary link to offer account registration If the registration link is clicked, the user is shown a page that prompts personal details in order to create an account Upon successful account creation, a \"continue to login\" page is presented The OTP authentication flow of the previous section is reused: a standard login form is shown and then the user is prompted to enter a passcode. Registration # For the purposes of registration, a small flow was created: This flow is pretty simple and we are not going into the details here. Keep in mind the following: Upload confirmation.ftlh and index.ftlh files to folder /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl/samples/registration Copy the file RegistrationUtil.java to directory /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/io/jans/agama/samples Keep this flow disabled. If used standalone, it will finish but no actual person will be authenticated. It is not designed to be used directly but by other flows. Main flow # Source code here . This flow is short and powerful. To start it launches the email OTP authentication flow (line 4). However, instead of the login.ftlh template used internally by the basic flow, a different version is used (line 5). The new template is located in this flow's basepath, i.e. samples/otp-email-registration , and the file name does not change. This new page simply adds a small link that reads \"Don't have an account?\" in a new HTML form. When clicked it will provoke the email-OTP flow to be aborted early and the condition at line 7 will be truthy. If that's not the case, the email-OTP flow will proceed as usual and the current flow will finish in the same way as email-OTP (line 16). If email-OTP is aborted, the registration flow that we just saw is launched (line 9). Here the template confirmation.ftlh is overriden too (line 10). This new page changes the label of the button that is shown after an account has been created: originally the text is \"Continue\" but for the current flow, \"Proceed to login\" is a better fit. If the registration flow finishes successfully (line 12), the email-OTP flow is triggered again (line 14) - this time without customizations. Then the user can supply his recently-created credentials to get past the basic authentication stage and finally move to the OTP challenge. Recall that via registration flow the user's e-mail address is already stored in the database. Finally, the current flow finishes identically as email-OTP did (line 16).","title":"Sample Flows"},{"location":"admin/developer/agama/samples/#sample-flows","text":"This page provides some practical flow examples to help readers in their process of learning Agama.

To start it launches the email OTP authentication flow (line 4). However, instead of the login.ftlh template used internally by the basic flow, a different version is used (line 5). The new template is located in this flow's basepath, i.e. samples/otp-email-registration , and the file name does not change. This new page simply adds a small link that reads \"Don't have an account?\" in a new HTML form. When clicked it will provoke the email-OTP flow to be aborted early and the condition at line 7 will be truthy. If that's not the case, the email-OTP flow will proceed as usual and the current flow will finish in the same way as email-OTP (line 16). If email-OTP is aborted, the registration flow that we just saw is launched (line 9). Here the template confirmation.ftlh is overriden too (line 10). This new page changes the label of the button that is shown after an account has been created: originally the text is \"Continue\" but for the current flow, \"Proceed to login\" is a better fit. If the registration flow finishes successfully (line 12), the email-OTP flow is triggered again (line 14) - this time without customizations. Then the user can supply his recently-created credentials to get past the basic authentication stage and finally move to the OTP challenge. Recall that via registration flow the user's e-mail address is already stored in the database. Finally, the current flow finishes identically as email-OTP did (line 16).","title":"Main flow"},{"location":"admin/developer/agama/ui-pages/","tags":["administration","developer","agama"],"text":"Writing UI pages # Creating the pages that make up an Agama flow is rather straightforward for a developer.

Here, there is considerably less wrestling in comparison to using big frameworks like JSF. Template engine # To generate all output to be sent to the browser, the Apache FreeMarker template engine is used. This is a lightweight, versatile, and easy-to-learn open-source Java library. With FreeMarker any kind of text output can be produced, so Agama flows are not restricted to HTML markup exclusively. Developers are encouraged to take a peep at the FreeMarker manual before trying to write their first pages. The key concept there is Template + data-model = output which is pretty natural.

The following resources are useful as introduction as well: The Hello World flow presented in the quick start guide. Pay attention to the RRF instruction there Agama sample flows As you will see, the task boils down to produce the desired markup plus adding some placeholders for information that is dynamic. Data model # In Agama, every template is generally \"injected\" some data, see RRF . This data in FreeMarker terms is known as \"data-model\". In practice, this will be an Agama map which can be accessed from the templates using standard FreeMarker notation. This map is attached a couple of additional keys for developer's convenience: webCtx . It gives easy access to often needed bits like current path, locale, etc. This is a Java object you can inspect here . Take a look at the getters; writing ${webCtx.contextPath} in a template will insert the result of calling method getContextPath - normally the string /jans-auth . msgs . It gives access to the localized messages of jans-auth application. Some developers might know this as the \"internationalization labels\" or \"resource bundle\" of an application. This is a collection of .properties files where common UI-related messages in different languages can be found. A message (label) is identified by a key, so in a template ${msgs.<KEY>} could be used. As most keys in resource bundles have dot characters, the alternative notation ${webCtx[\"KEY\"]} works better for FreeMarker, for example ${msgs[\"login.errorMessage\"]} . Output encoding # The character encoding of the response sent to browser is by default UTF-8 . To specify a different encoding the ftl directive can be used, for instance, <#ftl encoding=\"ISO-8859-5\"> . Place this at the top of the template. Reusable templates # A widespread practice in web page authoring is to compose pages based on reusable pieces. As an example, the need for a common header and footer is ubiquitous in HTML projects. With FreeMarker, composition can be achieved by means of macros .

This allows developers to register a client with the Authorization Server (AS) without any intervention from the administrator. By default, all clients are given the same default scopes and attributes. Through the use of an interception script, this behavior can be modified. These scripts can be used to analyze the registration request and apply customizations to the registered client. For example, a client can be given specific scopes by analyzing the Software Statement that is sent with the registration request. Behavior # By default, Jans server has no dynamic client registration scripts enabled, and all clients are given the same attributes. When a script is added and enabled, the script will run and return a boolean after applying logic to the registration request. If true , the client is registered and client credentials are returned. Generally, the script is global for all registration requests, and only one script is enabled at a time.

However, there is still a large amount of metadata that may be attached to a token, such as its current validity, approved scopes, and information about the context in which the token was issued. These pieces of information are often vital to protected resources making authorization decisions based on the tokens being presented. Token introspection allows a protected resource to query this information. Introspection scripts allows to modify response of Introspection Endpoint spec and present additional meta information surrounding the token. Interface # Introspection script should be associated with client (used for obtaining the token) in order to be run. Otherwise it's possible to set introspectionScriptBackwardCompatibility global AS configuration property to true, in this case AS will run all scripts (ignoring client configuration). Methods # The introspection interception script extends the base script type with the init , destroy and getApiVersion methods: Inherited Methods Method description def init(self, customScript, configurationAttributes) This method is only called once during the script initialization. It can be used for global script initialization, initiate objects etc def destroy(self, configurationAttributes) This method is called once to destroy events. It can be used to free resource and objects created in the init() method def getApiVersion(self, configurationAttributes, customScript) The getApiVersion method allows API changes in order to do transparent migration from an old script to a new API. Only include the customScript variable if the value for getApiVersion is greater than 10 The configurationAttributes parameter is java.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty> . The introspection interception script also adds the following method(s): Method def modifyResponse(self, responseAsJsonObject, context) Method Paramater responseAsJsonObject is org.codehaus.jettison.json.JSONObject context is io.jans.as.service.external.context.ExternalIntrospectionContext Snippet # # Returns boolean , true - apply introspection method , false - ignore it . # This method is called after introspection response is ready . This method can modify introspection response . # Note : # responseAsJsonObject - is org . codehaus . jettison . json . JSONObject , you can use any method to manipulate json # context is reference of io . jans . as . server . service . external . context . ExternalIntrospectionContext ( in https : // github . com / JanssenProject project ) def modifyResponse ( self , responseAsJsonObject , context ) : responseAsJsonObject . accumulate ( \"key_from_script\" , \"value_from_script\" ) return True It is also possible to run introspection script during access_token creation as JWT.

The Jans-auth Server persists these variables to support stateless, two-step authentications even in a clustered environment. 4. getCountAuthenticationSteps This method normally just returns 1, 2, or 3. In some cases, depending on the context like based on the user's country or department, you can decide to go for multistep or single step authentication. 5. getPageForStep Used to specify the UI page you want to show for a given step. 6. getNextStep Steps usually go incrementally as 1, 2, 3... unless you specify a case where it can be reset to a previous step, or skip a particular step based on business case. 7. getAuthenticationMethodClaims Array of strings that are identifiers for authentication methods used in the authentication. In OpenID Connect, if the identity provider supplies an \"amr\" claim in the ID Token resulting from a successful authentication, the relying party can inspect the values returned and thereby learn details about how the authentication was performed. 8. isValidAuthenticationMethod This method is used to check if the authentication method is in a valid state. For example we can check there if a 3rd party mechanism is available to authenticate users. As a result it should either return True or False. 9. getAlternativeAuthenticationMethod This method is called only if the current authentication method is in an invalid state. Hence authenticator calls it only if isValidAuthenticationMethod returns False. As a result it should return the reserved authentication method name. 10. getLogoutExternalUrl Returns the 3rd-party URL that is used to end session routines. The control from this Third party URL should re-direct user back to /oxauth/logout.htm again with empty URL query string. Jans-Auth server will then continue of the extended logout flow, restore the original URL query string, and send user to /jans-auth/end_session to complete it. 11. logout This method is not mandatory. It can be used in cases when you need to execute specific logout logic in the authentication script when jans-auth receives an end session request to the /oxauth/logout.htm endpoint (which receives the same set of parameters than the usual end_session endpoint). This method should return True or False; when False jans-auth stops processing the end session request workflow.

In some cases, depending on the context like based on the user's country or department, you can decide to go for multistep or single step authentication. 5. getPageForStep Used to specify the UI page you want to show for a given step. 6. getNextStep Steps usually go incrementally as 1, 2, 3... unless you specify a case where it can be reset to a previous step, or skip a particular step based on business case. 7. getAuthenticationMethodClaims Array of strings that are identifiers for authentication methods used in the authentication. In OpenID Connect, if the identity provider supplies an \"amr\" claim in the ID Token resulting from a successful authentication, the relying party can inspect the values returned and thereby learn details about how the authentication was performed. 8. isValidAuthenticationMethod This method is used to check if the authentication method is in a valid state. For example we can check there if a 3rd party mechanism is available to authenticate users. As a result it should either return True or False. 9. getAlternativeAuthenticationMethod This method is called only if the current authentication method is in an invalid state. Hence authenticator calls it only if isValidAuthenticationMethod returns False. As a result it should return the reserved authentication method name. 10. getLogoutExternalUrl Returns the 3rd-party URL that is used to end session routines. The control from this Third party URL should re-direct user back to /oxauth/logout.htm again with empty URL query string. Jans-Auth server will then continue of the extended logout flow, restore the original URL query string, and send user to /jans-auth/end_session to complete it. 11. logout This method is not mandatory. It can be used in cases when you need to execute specific logout logic in the authentication script when jans-auth receives an end session request to the /oxauth/logout.htm endpoint (which receives the same set of parameters than the usual end_session endpoint). This method should return True or False; when False jans-auth stops processing the end session request workflow.","title":"Person Authentication interface Methods"},{"location":"admin/developer/scripts/person-authentication-interface/#objects_1","text":"Object name Object description configurationAttributes configurationProperties passed in when adding custom script.

The authentication flow in the Jans Server is driven by the openID spec. The authorization request to the OP (Jans server) contains an optional query parameter called acr_values which is used by the OP to pick an interception script which will be run when /authorize endpoint (Authentication flow) is invoked. Each authentication method, whose name is the acr value, is tied to a PersonAuthenticationType script which offers the authentication workflow. Typically, a PersonAuthenticationType script can be used to: 1. introduce a new 2FA authentication mechanism 2. customize multistep authentication 3. offer Social logins 4. proactively perform fraud detection and block a fraudulent user.

Building blocks of an authentication workflow # Jans-auth server comprises of a number of beans, configuration files and Facelets (JSF) views, packaged as a WAR module. That means custom scripts and custom pages (JSF facelets) can make use of business logic already encapsulated in the Weld managed beans. The following sections explain how authentication flow can be built using a custom script. A. Custom script # The PersonAuthenticationType script is described by a java interface whose methods should be overridden to implement an authentication workflow. The article talks about these methods in detail and the psuedo code for each method. B. UI pages: # All web pages are xhtml files. The Command-Action offering by JSF framework is used by the Jans-auth server to implement authentication flows. a. Server-side actions implemented by custom script: # The custom script's authenticate and prepareForStep implementations are called by the following java class - Authenticator . These methods are mapped as command actions and view actions respectively in the web page. Relevant methods: Signature Description boolean authenticate() Makes the authentication flow proceed by calling the authenticate method of the custom script String prepareAuthenticationForStep() Makes the authentication flow proceed by calling the prepareForStep method of the custom script b. Web page in xhtml: # The f:metadata and f:viewAction tags are used to load variables (prepared in the prepareForStep method of the custom script). These variables are rendered on the UI page. <f:metadata> <f:viewAction action=\"#{authenticator.prepareAuthenticationForStep}\" if=\"#{not identity.loggedIn}\" /> </f:metadata> A form submit takes the flow to the authenticate() method of the custom script. <h:commandButton id=\"updateButton\" value=\"Update\" styleClass=\"btn btn-primary col-sm-4\" action=\"#{authenticator.authenticate}\" style=\"margin:5px;\" /> c. Page customizations: # The Jans-auth server comes with a default set of pages for login, logout, errors, authorizations. You can easily override these pages or write new ones. You can easily apply your own stylesheet, images and resouce-bundles to your pages. This article covers all the details you need to write your own web page. C. Business logic in Custom script: # Jans-auth server uses Weld 3.0 (JSR-365 aka CDI 2.0) for managed beans. The most important aspects of business logic are implemented through a set of beans. Details and examples of this can be found in this article D. Third party libraries for use in the custom script # Java or Python libraries to be imported and used very easily. Remember, you can import a python library only if it has been written in \"pure python\". More details of this mentioned here E. Configuring the acr parameter in the Jans-auth server: # The acr parameter can be configured in the following ways : 1. Default authentication method: # default_acr : This is the default authentication mechanism exposed to all applications that send users to the Janssen Server for sign-in. Unless an app specifically requests a different form of authentication using the OpenID Connect acr_values parameter (as specified below), users will receive the form of authentication specified in this field. Internal ACR # If a default ACR is not specified, Janssen will determine it based on enabled scripts and the internal user/password ACR. This internal ACR, simple_password_auth , is set to level -1. This means that it has lower priority than any scripts, so Janssen server will use it only if no other authentication method is set. Use the jans-cli to update / look-up the default authentication method . Authentication method for a client (RP): # A client may also specify default_acr_values during registration (and omit the parameter acr_values while making an authentication request). Multiple Authentication Mechanisms # The Jans Server can concurrently support multiple authentication mechanisms, enabling Web and mobile apps (clients) to request a specific type of authentication using the standard OpenID Connect request parameter: acr_values . Learn more about acr_values in the OpenID Connect core spec . Enabling an authentication mechanism # An Authentication method is offered by the AS if its ACR value i.e. its corresponding custom script is enabled . By default, users will get the default authentication mechanism as specified above. However, using the OpenID Connect acr_values parameter, web and mobile clients can request any enabled authentication mechanism . Obtain the json contents of a custom script by using a jans-cli command like get-config-scripts-by-type , get-config-scripts-by-inum etc. Example : /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id get-config-scripts-by-type --url-suffix type:PERSON_AUTHENTICATION /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id get-config-scripts-by-inum --url-suffix inum:6122281b-b55d-4dd0-8115-b098eeeee2b7 Update the custom script and change the enabled attribute to true Level (rank) of an Authentication mechanism : # Each authentication mechanism (script) has a \"Level\" assigned to it which describes how secure and reliable it is. The higher the \"Level\", higher is the reliability represented by the script. Though several mechanisms can be enabled at the same Janssen server instance at the same time, for any specific user's session only one of them can be set as the current one (and will be returned as acr claim of id_token for them). If after initial session is created a new authorization request from a RP comes in specifying another authentication method, its \"Level\" will be compared to that of the method currently associated with this session. If requested method's \"Level\" is lower or equal to it, nothing is changed and the usual SSO behavior is observed. If it's higher (i.e. a more secure method is requested), it's not possible to serve such request using the existing session's context, and user must re-authenticate themselves to continue. If they succeed, a new session becomes associated with that requested mechanism instead. Usage scenarios # A. Implementing 2FA authentication mechanisms # FIDO2 : Authentications using platform authenticators embedded into a person's device or physical USB, NFC or Bluetooth security keys that are inserted into a USB slot of a computer OTP authentication : Authentication mechanism using an app like Google authenticator , FreeOTP or Authy that implements the open standards HOTP and TOTP SMS OTP : Email OTP: B. Implementing Multistep authentication # Redirect to previous step : The script here an example of how the number of steps can be varied depending on the context or business requirement. C. Implementing Social logins # You can use a PersonAuthenticationType script to allow users to sign using credentials from popular Social Identity providers or Inbound Identity Providers like Facebook, Google and Apple. After users authenticate, thier Social Identity Provider credentials are provisioned into the Jans-auth server. More on this topic in this article D. Proactively perform fraud detection # Impossible travel Testing an authentication flow # An example of a complete URL looks like this - ``` https://<your.jans.server>/jans-auth/authorize.htm? \\ response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://<your.jans.server>/admin \\ &client_id=17b8b82e-b3ec-42a2-bd90-097028a37f3 \\ &scope=openid+profile+email+user_name \\ &state=faad2cdjfdddjfkdf&nonce=dajdffdfsdcfff ``` To test , enter the complete URL for authorization in a browser or create a simple webmapage with a link that simulates the user sign-in attempt. If the server is configured properly, the first page for the selected authentication method will be displayed to the user. FAQs # 1. How can error messages be displayed on a web page? # FacesMessage bean is used for this purpose. from org.jans.jsf2.message import FacesMessages from org.jans.service.cdi.util import CdiUtil from javax.faces.application import FacesMessage ... facesMessages = CdiUtil.bean(FacesMessages) facesMessages.setKeepMessages() facesMessages.add(FacesMessage.SEVERITY_ERROR, \"Please enter a valid username\") The error will appear in the associated template using the following markup: ... <h:messages /> ... See an example here 2. How is redirection to a third party application for authentication handled in a script? # For user authentication or consent gathering, there might be a need to redirect to a third party application to perform some operation and return the control back to authentication steps of the custom script. Please apply these steps to a person authentication script in such a scenario: Return from def getPageForStep(self, step, context), a page /auth/method_name/redirect.html ; with content similar to the code snippet below - def getPageForStep(self, step, context): return \"/auth/method_name/redirect.html\" Contents of redirect.xhtml should take the flow to prepareForStep method ... <f:metadata> <f:viewAction action=\"#{authenticator.prepareForStep}\" if=\"#{not identity.loggedIn}\" /> </f:metadata> In method prepareForStep prepare data needed for redirect and perform the redirection to the external service. def prepareForStep(self, step, context): ..... facesService = CdiUtil.bean(FacesService) facesService.redirectToExternalURL(third_party_URL ) return True In order to resume flow after the redirection, invoke a similar URL to https://my.gluu.server/postlogin.htm?param=123 from the third party app which takes the flow back to the authenticate method of the custom script. So create an xhtml page postlogin.xhtml which will look like this : <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"> <html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:f=\"http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/core\"> <f:view transient=\"true\" contentType=\"text/html\"> <f:metadata> <f:viewAction action=\"#{authenticator.authenticateWithOutcome}\" /> </f:metadata> </f:view> </html> The <f:viewAction action=\"#{authenticator.authenticateWithOutcome}\" /> in step 4 takes us to the authenticate method inside the custom script def authenticate(self, configurationAttributes, requestParameters, step): . Here you can use parameters from request param = ServerUtil.getFirstValue(requestParameters, \"param-name\")) perform the state check (state : Opaque value used to maintain state between the request and the callback.) finally, return true or false from this method.","title":"Person Authentication"},{"location":"admin/developer/scripts/person-authentication/#person-authentication-scripts","text":"The Jans-Auth Server leverages interception scripts of PersonAuthenticationType which when implemented can facilitate complex multi-step, multi-factor authentication workflows.

With SCIM scripts, custom business logic can be executed when several of the SCIM API operations are invoked. This is useful in many situations, for example: Trigger notifications to external systems when certain resources are deleted Alter the actual responses the service produces Attach additional information to resources when they are created or updated Implement a fine-grained level of access to resources so different callers have permission to handle only a restricted number of resources Notes: # In this document, the term resources refer to those \"entities\" the service can manage, for instance, users or groups The term operation refers to any SCIM functionality accessible through its HTTP endpoints Basic development skills are assumed. Some grasp of Java and Python are required as well as understanding of the SCIM protocol. Interface # Methods # API Overview Custom scripts adhere to a simple API (ie. a well-defined collection of methods/routines) that is described in the following. It is advised to check the dummy script provided here as you read this section. Scripts' config properties All methods contain a configurationAttributes parameter, this gives access to the configuration properties of the script itself. This is a relevant aspect of Gluu scripts: they are all parameterizable!. configurationAttributes is a java.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty> and here is how SimpleCustomProperty looks. Basic Methods These are methods not related to SCIM operations but still play key roles: |Method Name|Description|Return Value| |:---|:---|:---| | init |Called when the (SCIM) service starts and every time the script properties or code changes|A boolean value describing success or failure| | destroy |Called every time the script properties or code changes (called before init )|A boolean value describing success or failure| | getApiVersion |Determines what methods are effectively called when SCIM endpoints are invoked|A positive integer| Pre-resource Modification They are called when the resource is about to be persisted. The second parameter in these methods hold the object that will be persisted to permanent storage, thus any change or manipulation upon the object will be reflected in the underlying database (as well as in the output of the SCIM operation call itself). These methods are called regardless of the API version used. Names are self explanatory: Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link createUser , updateUser , deleteUser user ScimCustomPerson createGroup , updateGroup , deleteGroup group GluuGroup Pre-resource modification methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the corresponding SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Note that update* methods are called for both SCIM PUT and PATCH operations. Post-resource Modification They are called after the resource is persisted. The second parameter in these methods hold the object that was saved. Any change or manipulation upon the object will not be reflected in the underlying database, but may still modify the service response. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 2. Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link postCreateUser , postUpdateUser , postDeleteUser user ScimCustomPerson postCreateGroup , postUpdateGroup , postDeleteGroup group GluuGroup Post-resource modification methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the corresponding SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Note that postUpdate* methods are called for both SCIM PUT and PATCH operations. Single Resource Retrieval These apply for SCIM operations that retrieve a resource by ID. They are called after the resource has been obtained from the database. The second parameter in these methods hold a reference to such object. Any change or manipulation upon the object will not be reflected in the underlying database, but may still modify the service response. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 3. Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link getUser user ScimCustomPerson getGroup group GluuGroup Single resource retrieval methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the whole SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Multiple Resources Retrieval These apply for SCIM search operations. They are called after the results have been obtained from the database. The second parameter in these methods hold a reference to such result set. Any change or manipulation upon the object will not be reflected in the underlying database, but may still modify the service response. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 4. Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link postSearchUsers results PagedResult postSearchGroups results PagedResult Multiple resources retrieval methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the whole SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Note that searching using the root .search SCIM endpoint will trigger calls to both of the methods listed. Advanced control These are alternative methods that allow to tweak the response the service produces. They can be employed to introduce complex business rules when operations are executed. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 5. Methods manageResourceOperation manageSearchOperation Example: Modifying Search Results # SCIM spec defines the concept of attribute returnability where some attributes should never be part of a response (like passwords), always be returned (like resource identifiers), or be returned by default unless otherwise stated by the excludedAttributes parameter. Assume you are maintaining a user base of secret agents that work for your company and need to avoid exposing information such as their physical addresses for safety reasons. To keep it simple let's restrict the scope to user searches only. In practice you should take steps to hide this data on user retrieval and update. Let's alter postSearchUsers 's second parameter ( results ) to ensure addresses are not leaked: for user in results . getEntries () : user . setAttribute ( \"jansAddres\" , None ) This is very straightforward code except for the usage of jansAddres . Shouldn't it be simply addresses as the known SCIM attribute? Scripts work with entities that are about to be persisted or have already been saved so they kind of resemble the database structure (schema in LDAP terms). It turns out that database attribute names rarely match with SCIM names. While it is easy to know the SCIM name of a database attribute, the converse requires checking the code, however since you already have the skill this shouldn't be a problem: in this Java class you'll find the representation of a user resource in SCIM spec terms. Pay attention to the addresses field and its associated StoreReference annotation that contains the attribute where addresses are actually stored. With that said, save your modifications. You may like the idea of adding some prints for enlightment like: print \"%d entries returned of %d\" % ( results . getEntriesCount () , results . getTotalEntriesCount ()) for user in results . getEntries () : print \"Flushing addresses for user %s\" % user . getUid () user . setAttribute ( \"jansAddres\" , None ) Ensure no addresses are returned anymore in your SCIM user searches. Happy testing! Controlling execution of SCIM operations # With the manageResourceOperation and manageSearchOperation methods you can make complex decisions on how processing should take place based on contextual data and the incoming payload. manageResourceOperation This method is invoked when any following operations are executed: resource creation, modification, removal and retrieval by ID. In case of bulks, the method is called for every operation that fits into these categories. Parameters are described in the table below: Name Description Class/Link context Provides contextual information about the SCIM operation being called such as type of resource involved, HTTP verb, request headers, query params, etc. OperationContext entity A non-null object representing the resource involved A descendant of Entry . If the resource is a user, it will be an instance of ScimCustomPerson . In case of a group, it will be a GluuGroup payload The payload sent in the invocation; null when the operation is removal or retrieval by ID The datatype depends on the operation called. Check the interface that suits best and inspect the first parameter's datatype. The class will belong to some subpackage inside io.jans.scim.model.scim2 This method is expected to return an instance of javax.ws.rs.core.Response that supersedes the output of the operation itself. In other words, the actual processing of the operation is skipped in favor of the code supplied here. However note that minor validations may take place in the payload before your code is actually called. Returning None transfers the control of the operation for normal processing (default Jans implementation). If the method execution crashes at runtime, a 500 HTTP error is sent. Notes: Possible values for context.getResourceType() are: User, Group, FidoDevice, Fido2Device context.getTokenDetails().getValue() is a shortcut that will give you the access token the caller employed to issue the service call Both context.getTokenDetails().getTokenType() and context.getTokenDetails().getScope() return non null values when the protection mechanism of the API is OAuth or test mode Note that for resource creation operation, entity basically contains the same data supplied in the POST payload . In this case, entity has not originated from the database and has not been persisted either For the case of modification, retrieval and removal, entity contains the data currently stored in the database for the resource in question Since many values come from Java code, you can always do getClass().getName() to get an idea of what type of variables you are dealing with To build custom error responses your can reuse some of the getErrorResponse methods of class BaseScimWebService This method offers a high degree of flexibility. Perform careful testing of your code and account all potential scenarios. manageSearchOperation This method is invoked when resource searches are performed. Parameters are described in the table below: name Description Class/Link context Provides contextual information about the SCIM operation being called such as type of resource involved, HTTP verb, request headers, query params, etc. OperationContext searchRequest An object representing the search parameters provided in the call (applies for both GET and POST) SearchRequest Unlike manageResourceOperation , no entity parameter is passed. This is so because making decisions based on already executed searches would have a performance impact. Instead you can use context.setFilterPrepend(...) to help restrict the search against the database: here you can pass a String value that will be interpreted as an SCIM filter expression (see section 3.4.2.2 of RFC 7644). When the search being performed already contains a search filter (i.e. searchRequest.getFilter() is non-empty), a new filter is created by appending both \"subfilters\" with an and operator. As in the case of manageResourceOperation this method is expected to return an instance of javax.ws.rs.core.Response . Returning None transfers the control of the operation for normal processing (the Jans implementation). If the method execution crashes at runtime, a 500 HTTP error is sent. The same recommendations given for manageResourceOperation apply here. If you build filter expressions in your method, ensure they are syntactically valid to avoid your callers getting unexpected \"invalidFilter\" 400 errors. Example: segmenting the user base Let's assume you make use of the SCIM attribute userType so that your user base is partitioned into three disjoint segments according to such attribute and you have designated its possible values to be: Contractor, Employee, or Intern. Suppose your company has three different applications that make management of users in every category, that is, only one application is devoted to manage contractors, another employees, and other interns. You are interested in consistently granting access so that no application can create, query or modify users that don't belong to its focus. To properly handle this multi-tenancy scenario, you decide to use the contextual information coming from every request to determine if the operation should be allowed or not. For this purpose you communicate every application developer to send an additional HTTP header in their call with a value that only you (the administrator) and the developer knows. Let's call it the \"secret\". For the sake of simplicity let's assume developers are external to the company and only you know their identities. They don't know each other so they cannot exchange secrets. The strategy to implement segmentation is rather simple: Alter the default SCIM script by supplying a custom implementation for the methods that control execution Make the HTTP header name be a configuration property of the script so that it is not hard-coded Add a configuration property that contains the mapping of userType value vs. expected header value in JSON format Adding and parsing config properties Using Jans Config CLI update the SCIM script and add properties: custom_header with value USER-SEGMENT-SECRET access_map with value { \"<random_string>\":\"Contractor\", \"<random_string>\":\"Employee\", \"<random_string>\":\"Intern\" } Save the changes. In the init method this properties should be parsed. To start, let's add some imports: from io.jans.scim.ws.rs.scim2 import BaseScimWebService import json Here is how init would look like: def init ( self , configurationAttributes ): self . custom_header = configurationAttributes . get ( \"custom_header\" ) . getValue2 () access_map_json = configurationAttributes . get ( \"access_map\" ) . getValue2 () self . access_map = json . loads ( access_map_json ) print \"ScimEventHandler (init): Initialized successfully\" return True Note no validations took place here: we assumed the script contains the properties, that they are non empty and have sensible values. Allow/Deny resource operations The first step is to know the kind of application that is calling our service. For this purpose let's create a method that given incoming request headers returns the matching userType # headers params is an instance of javax . ws . rs . core . MultivaluedMap < String , String > def getUserType ( self , headers ) : secret = headers . getFirst ( self . custom_header ) if secret in self . access_map : return self . access_map [ secret ] else : return None Now let's code manageResourceOperation . We should allow access only under the following conditions: The getUserType method does not return None The entity object ( ScimCustomPerson instance) has a proper userType value. This means that for user creation, the incoming payload comes with a matching userType and for the other cases, the already stored attribute matches as well Assume that if the operation invoked is not user-related, we should allow access freely. Here is how the implementation might look: def manageResourceOperation ( self , context , entity , payload , configurationAttributes ): print \"manageResourceOperation. SCIM endpoint invoked is %s (HTTP %s )\" % ( context . getPath (), context . getMethod ()) if context . getResourceType () != \"User\" : return None expected_user_type = self . getUserType ( context . getRequestHeaders ()) if expected_user_type != None and entity . getAttribute ( \"jansUsrTyp\" ) == expected_user_type : return None else : return BaseScimWebService . getErrorResponse ( 403 , None , \"Attempt to handle a not allowed user type\" ) Note no usage of the payload took place. A case you may like to evaluate is where mistakenly using an update operation, the userType is set to an unexpected value. Allow/Deny searches This time instead of inspecting an entity, we ought to make a filter expression to restrict the search when the database is queried. For your reference, a valid filter expression is for instance userType eq \"Contractor\" . def manageSearchOperation ( self , context , searchRequest , configurationAttributes ) : print \"manageSearchOperation. SCIM endpoint invoked is %s (HTTP %s)\" % ( context . getPath () , context . getMethod ()) resource_type = context . getResourceType () print \"manageSearchOperation. This is a search over %s resources\" % resource_type if resource_type != \"User\" : return None expected_user_type = self . getUserType ( context . getRequestHeaders ()) if expected_user_type != None : context . setFilterPrepend ( \"userType eq \\\" % s \\ \"\" % expected_user_type ) return None else : return BaseScimWebService . getErrorResponse ( 403 , None , \"Attempt to handle a not allowed user type\" ) The manageSearchOperation must return a javax.ws.rs.core.Response . A None value makes continue the operation processing normally. Working with more than one script # You may have already noticed that it is possible to have several scripts under the SCIM type. This is how execution takes place when there are several scripts enabled: The applicable method is called in the first script. If the return value was True , the method is called again but this time in the subsequent script. If at any point a False return value is encountered, the SCIM operation is aborted with error 500. This means that a normal operation execution requires all involved methods across different scripts to be successful. There is an important exception to the above and is related to the manage* methods. In this case, only one script takes effect (the first script found). Note that in most cases having a single SCIM script suffices for all needs. Common Use Cases # Script Type: Python # Custom SCIM Event Handler # The sample code snippet shows how to - 1.

It is advised to check the dummy script provided here as you read this section. Scripts' config properties All methods contain a configurationAttributes parameter, this gives access to the configuration properties of the script itself. This is a relevant aspect of Gluu scripts: they are all parameterizable!. configurationAttributes is a java.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty> and here is how SimpleCustomProperty looks. Basic Methods These are methods not related to SCIM operations but still play key roles: |Method Name|Description|Return Value| |:---|:---|:---| | init |Called when the (SCIM) service starts and every time the script properties or code changes|A boolean value describing success or failure| | destroy |Called every time the script properties or code changes (called before init )|A boolean value describing success or failure| | getApiVersion |Determines what methods are effectively called when SCIM endpoints are invoked|A positive integer| Pre-resource Modification They are called when the resource is about to be persisted. The second parameter in these methods hold the object that will be persisted to permanent storage, thus any change or manipulation upon the object will be reflected in the underlying database (as well as in the output of the SCIM operation call itself). These methods are called regardless of the API version used. Names are self explanatory: Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link createUser , updateUser , deleteUser user ScimCustomPerson createGroup , updateGroup , deleteGroup group GluuGroup Pre-resource modification methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the corresponding SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Note that update* methods are called for both SCIM PUT and PATCH operations. Post-resource Modification They are called after the resource is persisted. The second parameter in these methods hold the object that was saved. Any change or manipulation upon the object will not be reflected in the underlying database, but may still modify the service response. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 2. Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link postCreateUser , postUpdateUser , postDeleteUser user ScimCustomPerson postCreateGroup , postUpdateGroup , postDeleteGroup group GluuGroup Post-resource modification methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the corresponding SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Note that postUpdate* methods are called for both SCIM PUT and PATCH operations. Single Resource Retrieval These apply for SCIM operations that retrieve a resource by ID. They are called after the resource has been obtained from the database. The second parameter in these methods hold a reference to such object. Any change or manipulation upon the object will not be reflected in the underlying database, but may still modify the service response. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 3. Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link getUser user ScimCustomPerson getGroup group GluuGroup Single resource retrieval methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the whole SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Multiple Resources Retrieval These apply for SCIM search operations. They are called after the results have been obtained from the database. The second parameter in these methods hold a reference to such result set. Any change or manipulation upon the object will not be reflected in the underlying database, but may still modify the service response. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 4. Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link postSearchUsers results PagedResult postSearchGroups results PagedResult Multiple resources retrieval methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the whole SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Note that searching using the root .search SCIM endpoint will trigger calls to both of the methods listed. Advanced control These are alternative methods that allow to tweak the response the service produces. They can be employed to introduce complex business rules when operations are executed. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 5.

Assume you are maintaining a user base of secret agents that work for your company and need to avoid exposing information such as their physical addresses for safety reasons. To keep it simple let's restrict the scope to user searches only. In practice you should take steps to hide this data on user retrieval and update. Let's alter postSearchUsers 's second parameter ( results ) to ensure addresses are not leaked: for user in results . getEntries () : user . setAttribute ( \"jansAddres\" , None ) This is very straightforward code except for the usage of jansAddres . Shouldn't it be simply addresses as the known SCIM attribute? Scripts work with entities that are about to be persisted or have already been saved so they kind of resemble the database structure (schema in LDAP terms). It turns out that database attribute names rarely match with SCIM names. While it is easy to know the SCIM name of a database attribute, the converse requires checking the code, however since you already have the skill this shouldn't be a problem: in this Java class you'll find the representation of a user resource in SCIM spec terms. Pay attention to the addresses field and its associated StoreReference annotation that contains the attribute where addresses are actually stored. With that said, save your modifications. You may like the idea of adding some prints for enlightment like: print \"%d entries returned of %d\" % ( results . getEntriesCount () , results . getTotalEntriesCount ()) for user in results . getEntries () : print \"Flushing addresses for user %s\" % user . getUid () user . setAttribute ( \"jansAddres\" , None ) Ensure no addresses are returned anymore in your SCIM user searches.

If so, then you MUST benchmark properly. It's critical that your test data and transactions mock what you need to prove in production. For cloud native deployments, benchmarking is also essential to test auto-scaling and failover. Ideally, you'll test the same hardware and network. Remember that OAuth has different flows, which have a different number of steps, and different requirements for compute and persistence. For example, the OAuth Client Credential Grant is very short: there is one token request, and one token response. The OpenID Code Flow has many more steps: it has a request/response to the authorization, token, Userinfo and logout endpoints. It's really important to test the exact flow you intend to use in production. Benchmarking also has the benefit of testing the index configuration in your database. Every database trades disk space for performance by using indexes. If you miss an index, performance sometimes comes to a grinding halt. Your service may even crash. Having confidence that all potential index scenario's get executed in your benchmarking is essential. Auth Server publishes JUnit tests and some tools for generating test data. Because each page rendered by Auth Server has a state, you cannot use a static load generation page tool. Don't forget to gather data on compute, storage, and memory. Also watch the resources consumed by the each web service and system service (e.g. database). You can't find the bottleneck without this data. System libraries and hardware choices may also impact your results. Benchmarking is an iterative process. Inevitably, things never go exactly how you guessed they would. And you make changes to your environment and run the benchmarking tests again-- ad naseum . Leave enough time for benchmarking. How ever much time you think it will take, triple your estimate. Make sure you look at both short tests and long running tests. A slow memory leak may only present after many hours of high load. Also, run some crazy tests, just so you know what happens. Some organizations benchmark for ten times normal volume. But when an incident happens, they see 1,000 times normal volume. Think outside-the-box. It's tricky load testing some newer two-factor authentication services, especially if they rely on new features of the browser. Hopefully the tools to benchmark these will evolve. Janssen Auth Server supports a number of deployment models--both VM and cloud native. While cloud native architecture enables true horizontal scalability, it comes at a cost. Benchmarking can help you understand if that cost is justified.

First, to improve performance by reducing the number of writes to the disk. Second, to share session data in a clustered deployment. Janssen supports a few different options for caching, as controlled by the cacheProviderType . Also keep in mind that unless the sessionIdPersistInCache is set to True , Auth Server will store sessions in the database. In-Memory If you only have one server, you can use RAM as the cache. Watch the memory usage of Auth Server--if it gets too high you may want to switch to another cache mechanism. Database A \"database cache\" is an oxymoron. But in cases where you don't want another component or service, but you need the session replication for a cluster, it may be convenient to persist the \"cache\" data in the database. Couchbase If you are already using Couchbase for persistence, then Janssen Auth Server can use \"ephemeral buckets\", which exist only in memory, for caching. Redis The best choice if you need a cache service for LDAP, RDBMS, or Spanner. Great performance and low cache miss rate. Commercial Redis supports TLS, which is a good option if you need secure communication. Memcached Still a good choice, especially if that's what you already run for other applications. We have observed a slightly higher cache miss rate under high load, which is fairly atypical for most login applications. Cloud Cache Amazon ElastiCache or Google Memorycache offer both Redis and Memcached services. They work fine.","title":"Caching"},{"location":"admin/planning/central-auth-service/","tags":["administration","planning"],"text":"Older monolithic web access management platforms from the 2000's had features to allow central policy management--what users can access what resources. But modern federated digital identity platforms generally do not. That's true for two reasons. First implementing all the OAuth and OpenID features is already a wide swath of requirements. Second, policy management, or authorization, has itself become a nice market. Note the policy management platforms list in the RBAC planning guide page. With that said, if the number of policies is low, there are some ways to use Jans Auth Server as a central policy decision point. You could use the presence of OAuth scopes to signal to the policy enforcement point the extent of access. In this case, policies could be implemented as code in the Update Token interception script. A similar strategy is to use UMA access tokens (\"RPT tokens\"), in which case you would use either the RPT interception script or the claims gathering interception script to implement your policies (or a combination of both).

Auth Server : This component is the OAuth Authorization Server, the OpenID Connect Provider, the UMA Authorization Server--this is the main Internet facing component of Janssen. It's the service that returns tokens, JWT's and identity assertions. This service must be Internet facing. Database : Like most IAM platforms, Janssen requires some kind of persistence service to store configuration and other entity data (client, person, scope, attribute, FIDO device, etc.) As different databases are good for different deployments, Janssen supports a number of options: OpenDJ, MySQL, Postgres, Couchbase, Google Spanner, and Amazon Aurora. Other databases may be added in the future. Cache : Getting data from a disk is still the slowest part of any web platform. If you want higher transaction speeds, one strategy is to use a memory cache instead of the disk (i.e. database). Janssen was designed to store short lived objects in the cache, like the code in the OpenID code flow (which is only used one time) or access tokens, which only live for a few minutes. Currently Janssen has three options for cache: in-memory , which is suitable only for one node VM deploymetns; redis which is probably your best option; and memcached which you should use if a Redis cache service is not available (and tends to have more cache misses under high volume). Key Management Janssen does a lot of cryptographic signing and encryption. Where you store the private keys has an impact on the security of your Janssen platform. For cloud deployments, many providers are providing key storage as a service. You could also use the file system or an HSM. FIDO2 : This component provides the server side endpoints to enroll and validate devices that use FIDO. It provides both FIDO U2F (register, authenticate) and FIDO 2 (attestation, assertion) endpoints. This service must be internet facing. Config API : The API to configure the auth-server and other components is consolidated in this component. This service should not be Internet-facing. SCIM : SCIM is JSON/REST API to manage user data. Use it to add, edit and update user information. This service should not be Internet facing. CLI : While you can use curl to call the Config API, CLI is a command line tool that provides a simple single line options for configuration. In the background, it is just calling the Config API. To authenticate, you'll use the OAuth Device flow. The CLI need not be on the same server as any of the components (you can run it from your desktop). But you will need network connectivity to the Config API and the Auth Server. TUI : An menu-driven interactive tool for configuration, the \"TUI\" or \"text user interface\" might resemble an 90's BIOS configuration, but it gets the job done without the need for a web browser. Like the CLI, you can run it from anywhere, but need connectivity to the Config API and Auth Server. The TUI writes a \"CLI log\"--the one liner you could have executed to do whatever you just did in the interface. This will help you if you want to script stuff later on. Jans Core : This library has code that is shared across several janssen projects. You will most likely need this project when you build other Janssen components. Jans ORM : This is the library for persistence and caching implementations in Janssen. Currently, LDAP and Couchbase are supported. RDBMS is coming soon. Jans Eleven : Auth Server can use the Jans Eleven REST API for key operations, which in turns uses PKCS11 interface of an HSM. Basically, it's a strategy to share an HSM over a network. Agama : The Agama module offers an alternative way to build authentication flows in Janssen Server. With Agama, flows are coded in a DSL (domain specific language) designed for the sole purpose of writing web flows. Setup : Configuring a Janssen Auth Server platform is complicated. How do you generate the keys and certificates? How do you generate the minimal data set to start your system. The setup component helps you bootstrap a minimal system.","title":"Components"},{"location":"admin/planning/customization/","tags":["administration","planning","localization","international","language"],"text":"Customization and Localization # You can customize just about everything in the Janssen Platform.

In your application, you could read the user claims to find out the organization, role, or other information about the person managing data.

But what happens when there is more then one IDP? Before the person authenticates, how do you know to which IDP to send them? This challenge is called \"discovery\", \"where are you from\", or \"WAYF\". There are a few ways to handle discovery. Here are a few: Display a list of logos and enable the end user to pick the IDP. If you ever clicked on a social login button, you've experienced this approach. Use a different URL for each IDP, like https://customer1.saas.com or https://saas.com/customer2 . Based on which URL the person hits, you know where to send them. Prompt the person to enter something identifying, like their email address. You can use this to look up their home IDP. Use contextual information, like network address, geolocation, or browser data. Once you've figured out the person behind the browser, it may make sense to write a cookie so next time, you don't have to bother them.

Like it or not, we are highly reliant on making a secure connection from a web browser using X.509 security to ensure that we are connecting to a trusted web server. The cn of that web server certificate is the hostname of the server. There is no guarantee that a two distinct trusted root CA's have not issued duplicate certificates for the same hostname. Thus, if your DNS server is hacked, bad things may ensue. This is not a hypothetical risk. Actual attacks have been implemented by adding entries to a DNS server that look real, but point to the attacker's website. DNS attacks are very difficult for the end-user to detect. For example, https://account.acme.com v. https://accounts.acme.com --both would look ok to a typical end user. So rule number one: PROTECT DNS--the whole integrity of your identity platform is otherwise vulnerable. From a deployment perspective, remember that in most cases the hostname of your IDP points to the HTTP load balancer (unless you have a single VM deployment). In most cases, you will also terminate TLS in the load balancer. The DNS hostname is baked into the protocols. For example, the authorization endpoint may look like this: \"authorization_endpoint\" : \"https://account.acme.com/jans-auth/restv1/authorize\" Note that the hostname is built into the protocol, not just the Web TLS layer. If you were to change the hostname of your web server, your deployment would break, because you would have to update all the configuration data in the IDP that contains the hostname too. And you'd have to regenerate any X.509 certificates. For this reason, you should think carefully about the hostname before you run setup and create the base installation of your Janssen Platform. To change the hostname, we recommend you re-install. If you want to promote your configuration from development to production, you may also need to consider keeping the hostname the same--although be careful you don't hit production by mistake in your testing.","title":"DNS"},{"location":"admin/planning/identity-access-governance/","tags":["administration","planning","IAG","Identity Governance"],"text":"Janssen is not a governance platform, so it does not do any of the following: Role Management # Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is a strategy used by many organizations to authorize access to resources.

The load balancer also terminates the SSL connection, which offloads the cryptographic compute from the application. In cloud native jargon, load balancing is called HTTP Ingress. In your load balancer configuration, you can use any routing algorithm. There is no need for \"sticky sessions\", or whatever the load balancer you are using calls that. For example, it's ok to use even round robin. Although modern HTTP ingress controllers enable some very flexibility routing options to do A/B testing and zero downtime updates.

The OAuth Authorization Server can also send extra security context, like scopes (which typically communicate the extent of access), or other information about the software vendor or characteristics.

For a federated identity platform, this presents a number of challenges: Privacy: Customers must only see their own user information and data Trust: Customers trust a distinct set of RP's Authorization: Customers have specific police requirements UX: Customers brand all user-facing web pages and messages Logs: Customers see only their own log Custom Business Logic: Customers have special rules, for example to authenticate users, register clients, or issue access tokens. Cryptographic Keys: Customers have their own keys URLs: Customers host the IDP using their own domain name Quality of Service: Customers control response time and concurrency Access: Customers can access systems and data directly One key decision to make with regard to multitenancy is which systems to share. You could share nothing, which lowers deployment complexity but increases operational complexity. Or you could share everything, which is easier to operate, saves money on hardware, but requires a lot more code. Or you could land somewhere between--share some systems, but not others. If you want to address all the challenges of multitenancy, then a \"shared nothing\" approach makes the most sense. And with advances in cloud native deployment, gitops, and configuration as code, you can approach the cost savings of \"shared everything\" multitenancy today, especially if you leverage serverless, just in time auto-scaling. However, you will need some cloud natiuve devops gurus to pull this off. If having one top level domain is acceptable, it is possible to add a tenant_id property to each entity (for example, client and person entities). Auth Server and SCIM interceptions scripts enable you to filter results by adding this tenant_id to queries behind the scenes. For example, you could also render different login pages by using default_acr_values for clients. It's possible in the future Jansen Project will implement some kind of support to bundle a multitenancy approach that captures some of the properties described above at the code level, but for the time being, it is not a priority.","title":"Multi-tenancy"},{"location":"admin/planning/passwordless-auth/","tags":["administration","planning"],"text":"Auth Server is not proscriptive about how an organization authenticates a person. If you want to avoid passwords, that's great. Everyone knows passwords are terrible. Modern authentication flows use a series of web pages to mitigate sufficient risk, enabling them to issue an assertion about the subject's identity. In order to perform authentication, identification is a given. This implies that all authentication flows normally start with the subject asserting some kind of identifier: username, email address, phone number, or any other identifier that uniquely identifies a person. Auth Server is not opinionated about how you do this. You could prompt the user to enter their identifier. Or for example, you could ask the user to scan a QR code, and identify a phone identified with a person. With identification done, Auth Server can present any number of additional web pages to establish that identity. These pages can ask for any \"factors\". For example, if you want to perform two factor authentication in one step, you could use a FIDO 2 credential, which combines possession with either knowledge or biometric. But in practice, you could ask for any one or more combination of credentials--none of which must include password. Net-net, \"passwordless\" is really just marketing jargon. Normally it implies some kind of risk assessment to optimize user experience. If you can imagine any such authentication flow, you can implement it in Auth Server.","title":"Passwordless Authentication"},{"location":"admin/planning/persistence/","tags":["planning","LDAP","MySQL","Couchbase","Aurora","Spanner","Postgres"],"text":"The performance of the web tier is derived from the performance of the persistence tier. While memory-caching short lived entities to reduce persistence is an option, there are still long lived objects that need to be written to the disk. Picking the right database has a huge impact on the operational burden of a digital identity infrastructure. All database administration requires some black art--every platform has some secret knobs and levers that are critical to tuning, availability and rapid diagnosis. So beyond the performance requirements that determine the right choice for a database, you also need to consider operational concerns. Janssen's strategy is to provide optionality for persistence. There is no one size fits all solution for databases. The following section will detail some of the pros and cons of the various databases we currently support. OpenDJ (LDAP) Janssen supports Gluu's distribution of OpenDJ, and probably any other similar distributions like ForgeRock OpenDJ, Ping Directory Server, or Oracle Unified Directory. LDAP in general and OpenDJ in particular have been successfully backing authentication service for more then 20 years. People tend to think of the LDAP tree structure as fast for reads, and slow for writes. That's just not true anymore--OpenDJ is able to perform quite well for write operations as well. OpenDJ has mature replication support, excellent command line tools for administration, and excellent stability. The main disadvantage of OpenDJ is scaling large datasets for high concurrency. While you can get around this shortcoming with a global LDAP proxy, such a topology gets complicated and costly to operate, as you have to break up the data and configure multiple replicated topologies. As a rule of thumb, if concurrency of more then 120 OpenID code flow authentications per second are needed, you should consider another database. But for concurrency less then this, OpenDJ is an excellent choice. MySQL You know it... you love it. That's the biggest advantage. Performance is great out of the box. But if you have high concurrency, you'll have to figure out a plan for replication, and horizontal scaling. Postgres Same as MySQL above, but there are some great commercial distributions of Postgres like EnterpriseDB . Couchbase A JSON NoSQL database that supports automatic distribution of data for auto-scaling multi-region sharded cloud native deployments. Janssen only supports the commercial distribution--but the previously mentioned database properties are enterprise class. If you need to host your own database, and you need infinite horizontal scalability, Couchbase should be your goto choice. Aurora So you want MySQL, but you want Amazon to handle some of the care and feeding? Aurora enables you to consume database as a cloud service. Scalability is excellent and multi-region deployments are possible . The main catch is that write operations are limited to one region, with the ability failover to another region. But to accomplish this, you need a cloud engineer to implement it. Spanner Google's multi-region cloud database as a service, Spanner was purpose built for auto-scaling, multi-region persistence. It has it's own API, although recently Google added support for MySQL and Postgres drivers. MariaDB Coming soon! Similar to MySQL but more cutting edge.","title":"Persistence"},{"location":"admin/planning/platform-goal/","tags":["administration","planning"],"text":"Project Goals # Online trust is a fundamental challenge to our digital society. The Internet has connected us. But at the same time, it has undermined trust. Digital identity starts with a connection between a person and a digital device. Identity software conveys the integrity of that connection from the user\u2019s device to a complex web of backend services. Solving the challenge of digital identity is foundational to achieving trustworthy online security. Nothing builds trust like source code. At the Janssen Project, we believe that the software that powers the world's digital identity services must be open source. And that the open source project behind digital identity must be community governed. And that the community must have a mechanism to extend the software to solve any digital identity challenge. Functional Goals # Janssen focuses on open standards for run-time digital identity, specifically federated digital identity protocols such as OpenID Connect and modern client-side passwordless authentication like FIDO. The project may take on new digital identity standards as they are invented. Organizations can make Janssen authoritative for identity, or can configure Janssen as a consumer of identity. Janssen is not designed to act as a workforce identity management or identity governance platform. Security Goals # Janssen project seeks to tack the most challenging security requirements. This means keeping current with OpenID certifications, enabling cryptographic conformance with FIPS 140-2 and implementing best practices for software development lifecycle, including a transparent build process to enable government and non-government organizations to trust the software. Janssen Project is unapologetically Java. The reason is simple: Java has the most cryptographic implementations. Java Cryptographic Engines (JCE) are written by many companies and open source projects. It takes a long time to trust a cryptographic implementation. Not only does Java have the most options for cryptography, it also has some of the most trusted implementations, and when new algorithms are announced, it frequently has code first.

Janssen provides standard interfaces that make it possible to implement custom business logic in an upgrade-friendly manner. Janssen is also the home of the Agama programming language--the world's first code specifically designed to enable developers to write secure web authentication workflows. By lowering the bar for customization, Janssen seeks to expand the community of developers and content creators far and wide.

One benefit of RBAC is that it's deterministic-- from an audit perspective, you can tell who had access to what at any point in time. This is harder to achieve when contextual variables play a role in determining access. An OpenID Provider / OAuth Authorization Server like Jans Auth Server certainly has a role to play in the implementation of an RBAC infrastructure, but is not capable of delivering all the functionality your organization will need for a complete solution. For example, you may need a platform to define enterprise roles or to perform role consolidation. This is normally handled by an identity governance tool. Also, Jans Auth Server is not a policy management platform, like * Styra OPA , OSO * Zanzibar , or * Hashicorp Boundary or * Apache Fortress The tools above are just a few open source policy management frameworks. There are more commercial products in this space. Although Jans Auth Server may not be a complete RBAC solution, there are still some RBAC capabilities to consider. When a person authenticates using a web browser, the client can obtain user claims via OpenID Connect. It may make sense to send the role role claim to the client. You may also send the memberOf claim, if your organization uses group membership to manage roles. But what if you need to dynamically compute roles? Or if you don't want to over-share by sending all the roles and groups associated for a person? One strategy is to use the Jans Auth Server Update Token Interception script to render the role claim, either in the OAuth access token, the id_token or the Userinfo JWT.","title":"Role Based Access Management"},{"location":"admin/planning/security-best-practices/","tags":["security recommendations"],"text":"Janssen Project distributions are designed to be easy to deploy.

It's extremely important to disable any person authentication or other scripts not in use. Keys # Use RSA keys with a minimum strength of 2048 bits and Elliptic Curve keys with a minimum of 160 bits. Also, check the key rotation policy of your Auth Server. This differs based on your deployment model. A single server can handle key rotation locally, but if you have deployed a cluster, you must manage key rotation centrally. Admin Web Services # Make sure SCIM and the config API are not Internet facing. If you do expose SCIM, you should network restrict access as much as possible. Although SCIM is protected via OAuth or UMA access tokens, because a breach of SCIM would undermine the integrity of authentications, a multi-layer security approach is warranted. There is no use case for an Internet facing Config API--you should tightly control access to this service. Make sure no services are listening on external interfaces except for those that are absolutely required-- tcp/443 for the OpenID and FIDO endpoints. On Linux servers, a list of current listeners can be obtained with netstat -nlpt (for TCP) and netstat -nlpu (for UDP). In particular, make sure the internal databases used by Gluu to store all its configuration are not Internet facing. OpenID # Review the OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice IETF draft. Don't use the implicit flow. In the implicit flow, the client is not authenticated, and a token is returned from the Authorization endpoint. If the response_type in your OpenID Authentication contains token , you are using the implicit flow. Section 2.1.2 of the current OAuth Security Best Practices OAuth working group draft specifically warns against using the implicit flow. If you must use the implicit flow, Review the CORS filter configuration for Jans Auth Server. CORS restricts access to trusted domains to execute browser application requests to Auth Server endpoints. By default, the filter allows any RP to call OpenID endpoints.

If not, disable it by setting dynamicRegistrationEnabled to False . If Dynamic Client Registration is enabled, consider using software statements , and writing a Client Registration interception script to implement extra rules for software statement validation. Check the list of scopes to quickly assess which scopes the clients can potentially add to their registration entry without consent of OP's administrator. Make sure sensitive scopes are dynamicRegistrationScopesParamEnabled set to False. The Auth Server property dynamicRegistrationScopesParamEnabled controls whether default scopes are globally enabled; scopes defined as default will be automatically added to any dynamically registered client entry. For client authentication at the token endpoint, move away from shared secrets-- use either private key authentication or MTLS . A client secret is basically a password for your software application. Utilize asymmetric client authentication. Make sure your OpenID client applications check the state value, and verify that it is the same state posted in the original request. This is necessary to prevent Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Also make sure that clients use a non-static value for state (i.e. a one time non-guessable value). You can also verify the state in the s_hash claim of the id_token in the authentication response. This may sound obvious, but make sure your clients verify the signature of the id_token. The location of the current public keys of the OpenID Provider can be found in the configuration endpoint ( jwks_uri ). It is also recommended that clients implement a unique redirect_uri per OP. This may also sound obvious, but make sure you trust the OpenID Connect client software library that your developers are using to authenticate users. Also make sure OpenID Connect client libraries are updated expeditiously. Suggest to web developers that they read the OpenID Connect Basic Client Implementer's Guide , which provides a more reader-friendly narrative for how to use the OpenID code flow--the main flow for relying parties. Client developers should consider using a Request Object JWT, which prevents hackers from tampering with the request parameters. Request objects can mitigate the Malicious Endpoint Attack and the IDP confusion attack. Mobile developers should read RFC 8252 OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps and follow the recommendations there. It's really important not to store any client secret or private key in the application, because hackers can decompile applications to extract these secrets. That's why RFC 8252 recommends using PKCE to prevent Authorization Code Interception Attack, and use a SHA256 as the code challenge method. Use App Auth if possible for Android , iOS , or JavaScript .

As Jans How do you decide when to invoke stepped-up authentication? As Auth Server is not a policy enforcement point, or a policy management system, these two aspects are out of scope. But once you make a runtime decision that you need more evidence of identity, the OpenID Connect Authentication Request has a few features that can help you out. The first is prompt=login . This is a hint from the Relying Party to the OpenID Provider that re-authentication is needed. Not all OpenID Connect providers support this feature (for example, Google does not). However Auth Server does currently support this parameter, although there is a feature request to make it optional. The second is acr_values . In Auth Server, this provides a hint to the Auth Server to invoke a specific Person Authentication interception script. Typically, this would specify your workflow for additional authentication. If you are using Agama, you can also provide a hint for which Agama flow to invoke by adding __. Another more esoteric strategy is to use UMA claims gathering. In this flow, the subject's browser is directed to the claims gathering endpoint (i.e. front channel), at which point the claims gathering script could invoke an OpenID authentication, using the prompt and acr_values parameters mentioned above. If you want to see an example of how a client implements stepped-up authentication, you should checkout this mod_auth_openidc wiki page .","title":"Stepped-up Authentication"},{"location":"admin/planning/timeout-management/","tags":["administration","planning"],"text":"Warning: business expectations regarding timeouts may drive you crazy. There are several timeout values in Janssen Auth Server. And web application and mobile apps may have their own timeout thresholds. The holy grail of timeouts is when everything times out at the same time--IDP and applications. This is rarely attainable. Normally the application needs to handle gracefully the case when the IDP session expires first. And if the application session expires first, it may need to trigger a logout event at the OpenID Provider. Below is a list of some of the Auth Server configuration properties for timeouts that you should consider: sessionIdLifetime : serverSessionIdLifetime : sessionIdUnusedLifetime : sessionIdUnauthenticatedUnusedLifetime : spontaneousScopeLifetime : refreshTokenLifetime : idTokenLifetime : accessTokenLifetime : cleanServiceInterval : dynamicRegistrationExpirationTime : refreshTokenExtendLifetimeOnRotation : CIBA, UMA and Device Flow : have their own specific timeouts.","title":"Timeout Management"},{"location":"admin/planning/use-cases/","tags":["architecture","use-cases","planning"],"text":"Browser Single Sign-On (B-SS0) # Web browser SSO is one of the main use cases for Janssen. The OpenID Connect interfaces of the Auth Server provide the identity layer that manages authentication and B-SSO. Auth Server tracks web browser sessions via a cookie. An end user may actually have several active sessions, although only one session is active. For example, below is a hypothetical session cookie: session_id: c691e83d-eb1b-41f0-b453-fab905681b5b current_sessions: [\"de510ab6-b06c-4393-86d8-12a7c501aafe\", \"c691e83d-eb1b-41f0-b453-fab905681b5b\"] To switch sessions, an RP can redirect to the Jans Auth Server OpenID Connect Provider authorization endpoint with the parameters prompt=select_account . Native Single Sign-On (N-SS0) # On most mobile platforms, mobile apps signed by the same vendor certs can share information via the system \"keychain\" (Account Manager on Android). OpenID Mobile SSO specifies a new scope, extends the token endpoint and profiles the OAuth2 Token Exchange spec allowing mobile apps to share identity between apps produced and signed by the same vendor (i.e. signed with the same vendor certificate). Single Logout (SLO) # The bane of identity engineers everywhere, Auth Server does offer some endpoints that enable SLO. Janssen Auth Server implements Back-Channel Logout and Session Management . But the most commonly used strategy is Front-Channel Logout . This works by displaying a web page with numerous iFrames, each with the respective logout URL for each application. The reason SLO is so hard is that logout is inherently an asynchronous use case. When you need a bunch of websites to receive a notification, some of those notifications may fail. Ideally, you'd replay messages that aren't received. But end users want a fast logout response, and don't want to wait for all the applications to confirm they received and acted on the notification. So making logout synchronous is a round-hole / square peg situation. But with that said, Auth Server supports it. API Access Management # Janssen Auth Server is frequently used to issue access tokens to authenticate software clients that needs to call an API. The OAuth WG has published many useful specifications about how to do this securely, and Janssen implements many of these RFCs and drafts. In OAuth parlance, Jans Auth Server is the Authorization Server; and Jans Client API is a service that helps clients with advanced features like MTLS and private key authentication. As OAuth scopes are frequently used to control the extent of access of clients, many domains are using Jans Auth Server to dynamically render scopes based on the identity of the client, or the security context. The Jans Auth Server also implements OAuth and OpenID client registration API. Finally, Jans Auth Server publishes an SSA endpoint, for OAuth software statement assertions which enables trusted services to request an SSA that specifies what type of clients can register. All of these features mean that Jans Auth Server is an essential tool as part of your API access management infrastructure. Multifactor Authentication # OpenID Connect is a web identity layer. Auth Server displays and processes a series of web pages to authenticate a person, and then shares user claims with the applications that requested them. Out of the box, Auth Server supports many MFA workflows, including FIDO, passkeys, OATH OTP (HOTP, TOTP), SMS (via Twilio or SMPP) and many more. But you're not limited to the MFA that comes out of the box. Using Person Authentication Scripts, you can implement any authentication workflow which you can imagine. You can also use the Janssen Project's Agama programming language to implement multi-step authenticaiton workflows. Mobile Authentication # One of the initial requirements for OpenID was to support mobile apps (because SAML is terrible for mobile apps). OpenID and OAuth have developed several mitigations that make mobile authentication more secure, which are desribed in RFC 8252 . However, due to the complexity of cookie sharing between the mobile phone browser SDK, and the mobile browser (assuming you are using the system browser), your results may vary if you actually want SSO. Recently, OpenID has published a new specification draft for Native SSO for Mobile Apps , which is on the roadmap . There are some other hacky ways you can implement mobile authentication, for example, using the OAuth password grant--but this is possible only for first party applications, and is generally discouraged, because there is no way to securely store a client secret in the mobile application, which hackers can easily decompile. Open Banking # You'll notice that the Gluu Open Banking Identity Platform is certified for Financial-grade API (FAPI) 1.0 Final--this is Gluu's distribution of Janssen Auth Server profiled for banking. If you want to implement an OP for open banking, Jans Auth Server is one of the few comprehensive open source platforms that will enable you to do so. Social Sign-in # This could really be covered under the MFA section. But it's not uncommon that as part of an authentication workflow, Auth Server may redirect you to an external identity provider, which then sends you back to Auth Server with some kind of reference id or assertion. Out of the box, Jans supports the top three social sites: Google, Apple, Facebook (which account for 80% of social login). But of course you can implement any social login using an Agama project. Registration # It's not that uncommon that an authentication workflow is used to create an account for a person in an identity provider. In fact, it's so common, that the OpenID working group recently created a spec to standardize a parameter in the authentication request to signal to the OpenID Provider that this is what's happening: prompt=create . As we're just displaying a series of web pages, we can display a registration form, process the form (with some kind of remote identity proofing?), send email, SMS, Telegram messages or whatever. Also, frequently social login is tied to registration--the first time you login with an external IDP, Auth Server creates an account of the fly with the user claims sent by the remote IDP. Authorization # Frequently people conflate the identity layer with the authorization layer. RBAC is still an important security paradigm. So it makes sense to people that the place where you store information about a person's roles, is where you define policies about what resources a role can access (i.e. policies). Recently, centralized authorization has had an active resurgence. Companies like [Styra][https://www.styra.com/], Oso , and HashiCorp have introduced innovative centralized authorization software. These systems, acting as a \"policy decision point\", enable you to define policies, and can evaluate these policies at runtime. Note: they rely on \"policy enforcement points\" to call their endpoints, supplying the data which is input to policies. With that said, there are places in Auth Server that you can define or impact authorization (besides user claims). In particular, OAuth scopes are used to convey the extent of access in an access token, that when presented to an API by a software client, enables access control. However, scope is still input to policy, and may in fact be just one more piece of data considered by a policy decision point. And one more caveat... the \"authorization\" in an OAuth \"authorization server\", was originally meant to convey the authorization of the person who was trying to access something. Whether a person consented to share information, or grant a client the ability to act on their behalf, is another important consideration. So does \"Auth Server\" provide authorization? It depends! Consent Gathering # Through the \"front channel\" (i.e. the browser), Auth Server can interact with a person by displaying web pages. OpenID Connect and OAuth scopes trigger the authorization phase (after authentication). By default, the scopes requested by the client and their respective descriptions are displayed for approval. However, like all pages in Auth Server, these pages can be customized to meet your exact requirements. Auth Server also implements the User Managed Access Protocol (\"UMA\"). This profile of OAuth2 enables consent to be sought from a person even after the initial authentication has taken place. This phase is also called \"claims gathering\", but one of the claims could be whether a person consents to something. Note: Authorizations are stored relative to a person's entity in the database. How a person views and revokes consent is outside the scope of Auth Server. To view a person's consents, you need to use the config API, as this information is not shared via OpenID Connect or SCIM.","title":"Use Cases"},{"location":"admin/planning/use-cases/#browser-single-sign-on-b-ss0","text":"Web browser SSO is one of the main use cases for Janssen.

You could cluster Janssen using VM's, but you'll have to do some legwork, because we don't publish tools for this task. This planning guide will cover some of the things you'll need to consider. Hostname Remember when you run the linux setup to use the hostname of the cluster,not the hostname of the individual server. This is important because the OpenID Provider metadata needs to use the public hostname (i.e. the URL's you'll find at /.well-known/openid-configuration ) Load Balancing / SSL As Auth Server and FIDO (the two Internet facing components) are stateless, you can use any load balancer routing algorithm, even round robin. You can also use the load balancer to terminate SSL. Database The web services Janssen Components share the database, so you'll have to use database replication (e.g. OpenDJ replication). You could also use a cloud database that takes care of replication for you. Cache You can't use IN-MEMORY cache which would have no way to replicate to the other nodes in the network. You could use the Database for caching, although this will impact performance, although it's only an issue for high concurrency use cases. If you are using Couchbase, it has caching built-in. But if you are another database and need high concurrency, our recommendation is to use Redis for caching, which has less cache hit misses then Memcached. Key management Where to you store the private keys? If on the file system, you'll have to make sure that they get securely copied. This is trickier then it sounds because of key rotation. OpenID Connect working group suggests key rotation every two day, to make sure developers who write OpenID applications handle key rotation properly in their code, and don't hardcode the metadata, but retrieve it from the OpenID configuration endpoint.

If you do a good job at monitoring, and can restore from backup quickly, it's certainly possible to meet an SLA of 99.9% availability using just one server. Janssen has linux packages available for SUSE, Red Hat and Ubuntu. One operational consideration is that you should hold the version of Jans Auth Server, to avoid update during the normal package update process. As many applications may rely on a central IDP, you want to plan updates and have a rollback plan if something goes wrong. An automated, unattended update process for the IDP is too risky. An important security tradeoffs when you run Janssen on a single VM is that services which you want to control access to are running on a server with an Internet-facing ethernet interface: the Config API, database, and SCIM server. Even though these service are running on localhost , if the Internet facing interface was compromised, network protection could be bypassed. The main advantage of running a single VM is simplicity. Your sys admins won't need any special training. And it will be easy to install, backup, monitor, and configure your deployment. If you have many autonomous domains, each with their own brand and user identity management process, the simplicity of running a single IDP might be the best solution.

Components # The Passport Social authentication script The Passport JS Project Authentication Flow # After users authenticate at the external social identity provider, the control flows back to Janssen Authentication server where the user is verified and the user-id is provisioned into the Janssen server. Diagram source file Role of Passport-JS project and Janssen's Authentication server # Passport-js project encrypts and signs user data before passing it to the Janssen server. Janssen Auth server verifies the received JWT, decrypts data, add/update user into LDAP, and marks the user as authenticated. Check Script Code For details. Diagram source file Setup and configurations # Setup Passport JS Project # Passport JS is very good library in Node JS which helps to add many social provider authentication in project. For this Inbound Jans Flow, You have to make a Passport Node JS project which help to generates auth request for your external social providers, get the user information, and send it to the Janssen server. Below things need to add in Passport JS Project to setup complete auth flow with Jans. Make a token endpoint which expose token with unique id. Jans will use this endpoint to get token and use this token for secur auth request. Passport Project has to validate this token in Jans request. This is just a simple strategy to protect passport endpoint from spam requests and only allow jans to request it. Code sample: // Encryption compatible with Jans EncryptionService // Salt File path: /etc/jans/conf/salt router . get ( '/token' , function ( req , res , next ) { const t = jwt . sign ( { jwt : uuidv4 () }, '<saltfilevalue>' , { expiresIn : 120 } // 2 min expiration ) res . status ( 200 ). send ({ token_ : t }) // key should be token_ } ) You need to use Salt File /etc/jans/conf/salt as a secret key. You will get this salt file after Jans intallation. Jans interception script uses this same file for decryption. Create auth request endpoints which will be request by User on Jans auth login page. For Example: Suppose you have added google strategy in your passport project. In that case you can make a endpoint like /google/:token . google is provider id in providers_json_file . token is the same token which we created in above step. After authentication Passport Project has to send encoded userinfo data to Jans https://<your.jans.server.com>/jans-auth/postlogin.htm . Below is the Node JS code sample to send POST request with data to Jans Post Login Endpoint. const postUrl = \"https://<your.jans.server.com>/jans-auth/postlogin.htm\" res . set ( 'content-type' , 'text/html;charset=UTF-8' ) return res . status ( 200 ). send ( ` <html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xml:lang=\"en\"> <body onload=\"document.forms[0].submit()\"> <noscript> <p> <b>Note:</b> your browser does not support JavaScript, please press the Continue button to proceed. </p> </noscript> <form action=\" ${ postUrl } \" method=\"post\"> <div> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"user\" value=\" ${ jwt } \"/> <noscript> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Continue\"/> </noscript> </div> </form> </body> </html>` ) Check next step to generate jwt . To make encoded userinfo data, use jwt private key signing technique. Check below sample code: // mapped user info data with ldap attributes const user = { uid : profile . username || profile . id , mail : profile . email , cn : profile . displayName , displayName : profile . displayName , givenName : profile . name . givenName , sn : profile . name . familyName , provider : \"<your-social-provider-name>\" , // e.g. google } jwt . sign ({ iss : 'https://<your.jans.server.com>/jans-auth/postlogin.htm' , sub : user . uid , aud : 'https://<your.jans.server.com>' , jti : uuidv4 (), exp : now / 1000 + 30 , iat : now , data : encrypt ( user ) }, privateKey , defaultRpOptions ) // Check `generate Keystore` section below to generate keys const privateKey = `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Your Private Key xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -----END PRIVATE KEY-----` cosnt defaultRpOptions = { algorithm : config . get ( 'keyAlg' ), header : { typ : 'JWT' , alg : config . get ( 'keyAlg' ), kid : config . get ( 'keyId' ) } } function encrypt ( obj ) { // Encryption compatible with Jans EncryptionService // Salt File path: /etc/jans/conf/salt const pt = JSON . stringify ( obj ) const encrypt = crypto . createCipheriv ( 'des-ede3-ecb' , '<saltfilevalue>' , '' ) let encrypted = encrypt . update ( pt , 'utf8' , 'base64' ) encrypted += encrypt . final ( 'base64' ) return encrypted } Follow Steps in Generate Keystore section to generate private key. You can add as many as possible passport strategies in your passport project. Above steps are little complex, use this sample code file to build your passport application. Apache proxy setup # For seamless flow, You can deploy Passport Project on Jans server and you can use an apache proxy pass to configure the passport with jans-server. Add the below configuration to the Janssen apache server and restart the apache server. <Location /passport> ProxyPass http://localhost:8090/passport retry=5 connectiontimeout=60 timeout=60 Order deny,allow Allow from all </Location> After this configurations, you need to use jans-fqdn in passport callback URL. This is optional configurations, you can deploy your passport project on another server. Add passport-social script # Download the script from here and add it to Janssen Server using jans-cli . After Janssen Server installation, you will get jans-cli . Follow this jans-cli guide to add a custom script in Janssen. The custom script has the following properties: Property Description key_store_file Keystore file path. Use these instructions to create a keystore. key_store_password Keystore file secret password providers_json_file Array of JSON Objects. Provider JSON file with social provider which you want to add for authentication. passport_fqdn Passport FQDN e.g. https://your-passport.com passport_token_endpoint_path It will use passport_fqdn as a prefix so just add path. e.g. /passport/token . Jans request this endpoint to get token for next auth request here . Check Step-1 in Setup Passport section to make token endpoint. passport_auth_endpoint_path It will use passport_fqdn as a prefix so just add path. e.g. /passport/auth . Jans request this endpoint to initiate auth request here . Check Step-2 in Setup Passport section to make passport auth endpoint. Jans will append provider and token during auth request e.g. If you have added google provider with id google in providers_json_file then jans request will be look like https://your-passport.com/passport/auth/google/<token> . Note: After adding and enabling successfully, you can check your Janssen's Auth Server OpenID Connect configuration by navigating to the following URL: https://your-jans-server.com/.well-known/openid-configuration. Find \"acr_values_supported\" and you should see passport-social . Note: Once you initiate auth request from your RP Application make sure to add acr_values=passport-social in the request. acr_values is your script name. Below is the providers_json_file format: [ { \"id\": \"google\", \"displayName\": \"google\", \"requestForEmail\": false, \"emailLinkingSafe\": false, \"logoImg\": \"img-url-or-path\" } ] Property Description id Unique string for your provider displayName This name will be shown on auth page logoImg This logo image will be shown on auth page e.g. /jans-auth/img/glu_icon.png requestForEmail It is not required to be true . If you set it to true then it will prompt a user to enter an email. emailLinkingSafe It is not required to be true . If you want to link to existing users then set it to true Customize login pages # Passport-social script uses passportlogin.xhtml and passportpostlogin.xhtml which are already comes which Janssen installation. No need to do anything. For UI Customization, you can download current page source code from here , modify UI, replace pages at path /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/pages/auth/passport/ and restart jans-auth server. Generate Keystore # Passport sends private key sign user data jwt to janssen server, for that we need to generate Keystore. keystore is a safe and passport-protected private key container. Use the below commands: # generate Keystore keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -v -keystore <keystore-file-name>.jks -alias <kid-unique-string> Example: keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -v -keystore keystore.jks -alias kid-2s3d5-f5-6f5-f4dd4 This command will prompt you to enter a password. Whichever password you have entered, this same password you need to configure key_store_password at Janssen custom script configuration. <kid-unique-string> is your kid which you need for passport JWT keyId config. keystore.jks need it to configure key_store_file property at Janssen custom script configuration. # JKS to PKCS#12 keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore keystore.jks \\ -destkeystore keystore.p12 \\ -srcstoretype jks \\ -deststoretype pkcs12 # PKCS#12 to PEM openssl pkcs12 -nodes -in keystore.p12 -out keystore.pem You can see many things in keystore.pem . but we need only the private key part to make a new file and add the private key part there like in the below example: // private.pem -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- MIIEvgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKgwggSkAgEAAoIBAQCSETIkMkVKOwwO XkYVPaBdz+lhsXpMjMJR4dTdFzn01hvcEDUf57wLmgvBXnfWDXEyEFrsvQGePZw7 foYAdnCtSqZW+dLsh6SUxL5iK0uakiY4SBX401fpbhdCeSC1pK8K+qE3jgc/o60d oRAHLz/RCwaa8BszTwyxlLMh7xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxPQEK0b5mPeV84fZJlfbRv01PIrwGRZJtcWC9Ke5 xSBoh0uvpZ37z2CJC7HZSz+bYz0ZhYiX372gl7BUxbLYdCz2Z9l0DDhwCO68wCzC nualRv0U2Y5EYkekj180KnAR -----END PRIVATE KEY----- we need this file for the passport keyPath config.

In the process of setting up a working environment, we will see how to use the command-line tool jans-cli to manually register an OpenID Connect client with the Janssen server. We will also see how to configure Relying Party to communicate with the Janssen server. Hardware configuration # For development and POC purposes, 4GB RAM and 10 GB HDD should be available for Janssen Server. For PROD deployments, please refer installation guide . Prerequisites # Installed Apache reverse proxy that is SSL enabled Installed Janssen server. Refer to Janssen Installation Guide for instructions. Component Setup # In this setup, we have four important components. - Protected resource is a resource that we need to protect using authentication. A web application for example. - User workstation is from where the user will use a browser(i.e user agent) to access the protected resource - Apache reverse proxy with mod_auth_openidc is our reverse proxy server and relying party. - Reverse Proxy : In our setup protected resources will be accessible through the proxy's FQDN https://test.apache.rp.io . For simplicity, we will use a CGI script as a protected resource and host it on the Apache proxy itself. In a typical production setup, protected resources are usually hosted on a separate server. - Relying Party : We will use Apache module mod_auth_openidc to provide relying party(RP) functionality. RP implements authentication flows from OpenID Connect specification. For each incoming request, RP ensures that the request is authenticated. If the request is not pre-authenticated, then RP will coordinate with Janssen server to integrate authentication. - Janssen server is our open-id connect provider (OP). We will assume that the Janssen server is accessible at FQDN https://janssen.op.io/ Configure Janssen server # In this section, we will register a new OpenID Connect client on Janssen server. In our setup, the relying party (Apache with mod_auth-openidc) is the OIDC client. There are two ways you can register OIDC client with Janssen server. 1. Manual Client Registration 2. Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) Here we will use manual client registration. To register a new OpenID connect client on the Janssen server, we will use jans-cli tool provided by the Janssen server. jans-cli has a menu-driven interface that makes it easy to configure the Janssen server. Here we will use the menu-driven approach to register a new client. To further understand how to use menu-driven approach and get complete list of supported command-line operations, refer to jans-cli documentation . Run the command below on Janssen server to enter interactive mode. Note: jans-cli has to be authenticated and authorized with the respective Janssen server. If jans-cli is being executed for the first time or if there is no valid access token available, then running the command below will initiate device authentication and authorization flow. In that case, follow the steps for jans-cli authorization to continue running the command. /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py Running above command will bring up main menu as shown in sample below: To register a new OpenID Connect client, select OAuth OpenID Connect - Clients option ( 16 in above sample). Selecting an appropriate option will bring up related sub-menu. From sub-menu, select option for Create new OpenId connect client . Upon selecting this option, CLI will prompt for inputs required to register a new OpenID connect client. Provide inputs for the following properties: displayName: <name-of-choice> application Type: web includeClaimsInIdToken [false]: Populate optional fields? y clientSecret: <secret-of-your-choice> subjectType: public tokenEndpointAuthMethod: client_secret_basic redirectUris: https://test.apache.rp.io/callback scopes: email_,openid_,profile responseTypes: code grantTypes: authorization_code Once values for all the above properties are provided, input c at the prompt to instruct jans-cli to create schema using inputs provided till now. At this time, jans-cli will show the schema(JSON) that will be used to create a new OpenID Connect client on Janssen server. Verify that schema has captured all the provided inputs correctly. Now next step is for jans-cli to post this JSON schema to Janssen server to actually register new client. To do this, input y on the prompt. If the client is successfully registered then we will receive JSON data back. This data describes newly registered client. Some of these values from this JSON response, like inum and clientSecret , will be required when we configure mod_auth_openidc as a client. So keep this reponse JSON handy. See a sample of JSON response below: { \"dn\": \"inum=165bdf95-f15e-44f0-bdd7-cdac71fda8e0,ou=clients,o=jans\", \"inum\": \"165bdf95-f15e-44f0-bdd7-cdac71fda8e0\", \"displayName\": \"dm\", \"clientSecret\": \"a9894ba8-eb01-4a26-a69d-026f10a49272\", \"frontChannelLogoutUri\": null, \"frontChannelLogoutSessionRequired\": false, \"registrationAccessToken\": null, \"clientIdIssuedAt\": null, \"clientSecretExpiresAt\": null, \"redirectUris\": null, \"claimRedirectUris\": null, \"responseTypes\": null, \"grantTypes\": [], \"applicationType\": \"web\", \"contacts\": null, \"clientName\": \"dm\", \"idTokenTokenBindingCnf\": null, \"logoUri\": null, \"clientUri\": null, \"policyUri\": null, \"tosUri\": null, \"jwksUri\": null, \"jwks\": null, \"sectorIdentifierUri\": null, \"subjectType\": \"public\", \"idTokenSignedResponseAlg\": null, \"idTokenEncryptedResponseAlg\": null, \"idTokenEncryptedResponseEnc\": null, \"userInfoSignedResponseAlg\": null, \"userInfoEncryptedResponseAlg\": null, \"userInfoEncryptedResponseEnc\": null, \"requestObjectSigningAlg\": null, \"requestObjectEncryptionAlg\": null, \"requestObjectEncryptionEnc\": null, \"tokenEndpointAuthMethod\": null, \"tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlg\": null, \"defaultMaxAge\": null, \"requireAuthTime\": false, \"defaultAcrValues\": null, \"initiateLoginUri\": null, \"postLogoutRedirectUris\": null, \"requestUris\": null, \"scopes\": null, \"claims\": null, \"trustedClient\": false, \"lastAccessTime\": null, \"lastLogonTime\": null, \"persistClientAuthorizations\": false, \"includeClaimsInIdToken\": false, \"refreshTokenLifetime\": null, \"accessTokenLifetime\": null, \"customAttributes\": [], \"customObjectClasses\": null, \"rptAsJwt\": false, \"accessTokenAsJwt\": false, \"accessTokenSigningAlg\": null, \"disabled\": false, \"authorizedOrigins\": null, \"softwareId\": null, \"softwareVersion\": null, \"softwareStatement\": null, \"attributes\": { \"tlsClientAuthSubjectDn\": null, \"runIntrospectionScriptBeforeJwtCreation\": false, \"keepClientAuthorizationAfterExpiration\": false, \"allowSpontaneousScopes\": false, \"spontaneousScopes\": null, \"spontaneousScopeScriptDns\": null, \"backchannelLogoutUri\": null, \"backchannelLogoutSessionRequired\": false, \"additionalAudience\": null, \"postAuthnScripts\": null, \"consentGatheringScripts\": null, \"introspectionScripts\": null, \"rptClaimsScripts\": null }, \"backchannelTokenDeliveryMode\": null, \"backchannelClientNotificationEndpoint\": null, \"backchannelAuthenticationRequestSigningAlg\": null, \"backchannelUserCodeParameter\": null, \"expirationDate\": null, \"deletable\": false, \"jansId\": null } Configure protected resource # As mentioned under component setup , our protected resource will be hosted on Apache reverse proxy itself. It is a simple Python based cgi script that will print request header information and can be accessed through https://test.apache.rp.io/cgi-bin/printHeaders.py . Execute the steps below on Apache host to set up the protected resource: Create script file printHeaders.py vi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.py with content as below #!/usr/bin/python3 import os d = os.environ k = d.keys() print \"Content-type: text/html\\n\\n\" print \"<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>printHeaders.cgi</TITLE></Head><BODY>\" print \"<h1>Environment Variables</H1>\" for item in k: print \"<p><B>%s</B>: %s </p>\" % (item, d[item]) print \"</BODY></HTML>\" Add Apache cgi module to enable execution of CGI a2enmod cgi Change permissions for CGI script so that it can be executed by Apache chown www-data:www-data /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.py chmod ug+x /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.py At this point, printHeaders.py should be accessible at https://test.apache.rp.io/cgi-bin/printHeaders.py without requiring any authentication. Configure openidc module # Install mod-auth-openidc # On Apache reverse proxy host, add mod-auth-openidc using commands below apt-get install libapache2-mod-auth-openidc a2enmod auth_openidc service apache2 restart Configure mod-auth-openidc # Open /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf Add mod-auth-openidc configuration parameters given below for virtual host _default_:443 .

Upon valid authentication, Janssen will present the user with a consent screen where the user will be able to allow user attributes that can be provided to the app If allowed, the user will be successfully taken to the printHeaders.py page. In the process, mod_auth_openidc also requests user claims (i.e attributes) from the /userinfo endpoint of the Janssen server. And makes these claims available as environment variables to the application. printHeaders.py prints all the environment variables, along with user claims received from the Janssen server. The application can use this information to identify the user and also enforce access policies. Sample output below shows some of this user information and token information printed as part of environment variables: Environment Variables OIDC_CLAIM_sub: e205be81-6a85-4d83-9126 OIDC_CLAIM_email_verified: 1 OIDC_CLAIM_name: Default myname User OIDC_CLAIM_nickname: myname OIDC_CLAIM_given_name: myname OIDC_CLAIM_middle_name: myname OIDC_CLAIM_family_name: User OIDC_CLAIM_email: myname@mydomain.io OIDC_access_token: d6a12cce-f196-4da3-ba17 OIDC_access_token_expires: 165493257 HTTPS: on SSL_TLS_SNI: test.apache.rp.io","title":"Apache Reverse Proxy"},{"location":"admin/recipes/custom-web-development/authn-with-apache-reverse-proxy/#contents","text":"Overview Component Setup Configure Janssen server Configure Protected Resource Configure openidc module Test Complete Flow","title":"Contents:"},{"location":"admin/recipes/custom-web-development/authn-with-apache-reverse-proxy/#overview","text":"This guide describes steps to enable authentication for web applications using the Janssen server which is an OpenID Connect Provider (OP).

GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS : Path to Google credentials JSON file (default to /etc/jans/conf/google-credentials.json ). Used when CN_CONFIG_ADAPTER or CN_SECRET_ADAPTER set to google . Deployment Strategy # Deploy single OpenDJ instance Initialize the data (see Initializing LDAP Data ) Scale up OpenDJ instances and auto replication will occur by default (see also LDAP Replication ) Run python3 /app/scripts/deregister_peer.py inside the container before removing any OpenDJ instance (in Kubernetes, we can use preStop hook instead) LDAP Replication # The replication process is automatically run when the container runs, only if these conditions are met: There are multiple LDAP containers running in the cluster The o=jans , o=site , o=metric backends have not been replicated nor have entries Check the LDAP container logs to see the result and optionally run /opt/opendj/bin/dsreplication status inside the container. Replication Using Advertised Address and Port # WARNING: this feature is considered alpha and should be used with caution. By default, each container will open the following ports internally: 1636/tcp (LDAPS port) 4444/tcp (admin port) 8989/tcp (replication port) 7946/udp+tcp (Serf port) All replication communication is done via address that resolved from container's hostname (FQDN format; i.e. opendj-0.opendj.gluu.svc.cluster.local ). If somehow we want to use another address and ports, it can be done by running the following steps on each container: Set the CN_SERF_ADVERTISE_ADDR envvar; i.e. CN_SERF_ADVERTISE_ADDR=node1.example.com:30946 . Make sure there is port mapping between 30946 (node) and 7946 (container) for both TCP and UDP protocols. Note that node1.example.com address must be reachable from all containers. Set the CN_LDAP_ADVERTISE_ADMIN_PORT envvar; i.e. CN_LDAP_ADVERTISE_ADMIN_PORT=30444 . Make sure there is port mapping between 30444 (node) and 30444 (container). Set the CN_LDAP_ADVERTISE_LDAPS_PORT envvar; i.e. CN_LDAP_ADVERTISE_LDAPS_PORT=30636 . Make sure there is port mapping between 30636 (node) and 1636 (container). Set the CN_LDAP_ADVERTISE_REPLICATION_PORT envvar; i.e. CN_LDAP_ADVERTISE_REPLICATION_PORT=30989 . Make sure there is port mapping between 30989 (node) and 30989 (container). Check the LDAP container logs to see the result of replication and optionally run /opt/opendj/bin/dsreplication status -X inside the container. Serf Encryption Key # Each Serf agent running inside the container requires same encryption key to communicate to each other. The key is resolved by the following order: Load from secrets (if any). Load from file (if any) where the absolute path is defined in CN_SERF_KEY_FILE environment variable (default to /etc/jans/conf/serf-key ). The key size must be a 16, 24, or 32 bytes encoded as base64 string. Example of valid key string: # python 3.6+ python - c \"import secrets, base64; print(base64.b64encode(secrets.token_bytes()).decode())\" # output: Z51b6PgKU1MZ75NCZOTGGoc0LP2OF3qvF6sjxHyQCYk= This key will be saved to secrets.

It is responsability of the concrete provider flow how to implement this aspect. The main flow can remain unmodified regardless of any change in existing flows or when new ones are added. Feel free to modify this flow or create one based on it if customizations are required. Deployment # Add agama-inbound jar # To start, let's add the required libraries to the authentication server: Visit this page, navigate to the folder matching your Janssen server version, and download the file suffixed with jar-with-dependencies.jar SSH to the server. Transfer the file to directory /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/libs Navigate to /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/webapps and edit the file jans-auth.xml by adding <Set name=\"extraClasspath\">./custom/libs/*</Set> before the root tag closes Restart the server, e.g. systemctl restart jans-auth Add the basic authentication flow # The basic authentication flow is employed when no provider is picked from the list (step 1 here ) but the option to use an existing local account is taken. This flow is detailed in the Agama sample flows page , however those contents can be skipped for the purpose of this setup. Ensure Agama engine is enabled . Download the basic flow source file Use the API for adding flows as explained here and here . A sample curl command would look like this: curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' --data-binary @io.jans.flow.sample.basic https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/io.jans.flow.sample.basic - In the server, navigate to /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl . Create the folder hierarchy samples/basic there Download the login template to basic directory Add the main inbound flow # Download the flow source and add it as you did with the basic flow, ensure you use io.jans.inbound.ExternalSiteLogin this time In the server, navigate to /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama . Create folders named inboundID inside existing ftl and fl subdirectories Download the default logo and place it inside /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/fl/inboundID folder Download the provider selector template and place it inside /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/ftl/inboundID folder. Note templates go under ftl , not fl . Do the same with the e-mail prompt template Add a provider flow # For simplicity, we'll illustrate here how to add one of the already implemented demo flows, namely, Facebook. Some guidelines on how to create a provider flow your own are given here . Download the utility flows . Add them to the server as you did with the main flow Download the Facebook flow code . Add it using the API as well Download the logo image and place it in /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/agama/fl/inboundID Login to Facebook and register as developer. Create an application with Facebook login capabilities. In the Facebook login settings add https://<your-host>/jans-auth/fl/callback as a valid OAuth redirect URI. Finally grab the app Id and secret from the app settings page Set configuration parameters # Create a JSON file like the below. Replace data in the placeholders appropriately: [{ \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/metadata/properties\", \"value\": { \"authzEndpoint\": \"https://www.facebook.com/v14.0/dialog/oauth\", \"tokenEndpoint\": \"https://graph.facebook.com/v14.0/oauth/access_token\", \"userInfoEndpoint\": \"https://graph.facebook.com/v14.0/me\", \"clientId\": \"<APP-ID>\", \"clientSecret\": \"<APP-SECRET>\", \"scopes\": [\"email\", \"public_profile\"] } }] Patch the flow using the API. A sample curl command would look like this (assuming the JSON file is named fb.json ): curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json-patch+json' -X PATCH -d@fb.json https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/io.jans.inbound.Facebook Later, we'll dive into the meaning of the configuration parameters set in this JSON file. Parameterize the main flow # So far, if the main flow is launched (learn about this topic here ) a screen with an empty \"Sign in with\" list will be shown. Adding information about the known providers is required. Create a JSON file like the below: [{ \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/metadata/properties\", \"value\": { \"facebook\": { \"flowQname\": \"io.jans.inbound.Facebook\", \"displayName\": \"Facebook\", \"mappingClassField\": \"io.jans.inbound.Mappings.FACEBOOK\", \"logoImg\": \"facebook.png\" } } }] Patch the main flow using the API. A sample curl command would look like this (assuming the JSON file is named main.json ): curl -k -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json-patch+json' -X PATCH -d@main.json https://<your-host>/jans-config-api/api/v1/agama/io.jans.inbound.ExternalSiteLogin Later, we'll dive into the meaning of the configuration parameters set in this JSON file. Note : for limitations in the PATCH endpoint, do not use \"op\": \"add\" to add another provider. Use \"op\": \"replace\" and pass the whole JSON configuration (all providers) for value . Test # Launch the main flow (learn about this topic here ). If everything was setup correctly, a screen with a \"Sign in using\" heading will be shown and next to it a link titled \"Facebook\". When clicking on the link, the browser will be taken to the Facebook website for authentication. A prompt for consent of release of personal information may appear as well. Finally, the browser is taken back to your server and then to the target application as described here . Configuration parameters of flows # Main flow configurations # Configuration is supplied in a JSON object whose keys are the identifiers of the existing identity providers. The associated value for a key is a JSON object itself and follows the structure represented by this Java class. This is an example of a configuration for a couple of identity providers: { \"github\": { \"flowQname\": \"io.jans.inbound.Github\", \"displayName\": \"Github\", \"mappingClassField\": \"io.jans.inbound.Mappings.GITHUB\", }, \"google\": { \"flowQname\": \"io.jans.inbound.Google\", \"displayName\": \"Google\", \"mappingClassField\": \"io.jans.inbound.Mappings.GOOGLE\", \"enabled\": false, \"skipProfileUpdate\": true } } The table below explains the meaning of properties: Name Description Mandatory flowQname The qualified name of the Agama flow associated to this provider Yes displayName Short name of the provider (will be shown in the selector page) Yes mappingClassField The qualified name of the attribute mapping for this provider Yes logoImg Relative path to the logo image (will be shown in the selector page) No enabled A boolean value indicating whether this provider can be shown (and triggered) from the main flow or not. Default value is true No skipProfileUpdate Determines if profile data should not be updated for a user if an entry already exists locally for him. Default value is false No cumulativeUpdate When true , existing value(s) of an attribute are preserved when the incoming profile data already contains value(s) for such attribute, otherwise its values are replaced by the incoming ones entirely. Default value is false No requestForEmail Whether to prompt the user to enter his e-mail if the data supplied by the identity provider does not contain one. Default value is false No emailLinkingSafe Determines if an existing account with the same e-mail of the user about to be provisioned can be treated as the same person No Notes: logoImg path is relative to the base path of the main flow, i.e. inboundID Set emailLinkingSafe to true only if you trust the provider, i.e. the incoming e-mail data is securely verified. For security, never set it to true when requestForEmail is also true Provider flow configurations # Configurations for this kind of flows don't have to adhere to any specific structure. Developers are free to choose what fits best for their needs. Also note provider flows must not receive any inputs: the main flow won't pass any arguments when triggering them. Thus, design your flows so there is no use of Inputs but Configs directive in the header . In practice many identity providers adhere to the OAuth2 code grant, so you can re-use the structure represented by this Java class for the purpose. Particularly, the already implemented flows (like Facebook) use it for their configuration. The table below explains the meaning of its properties: Name Description authzEndpoint The authorization endpoint as in section 3.1 of RFC 7649 tokenEndpoint The token endpoint as in section 3.2 of RFC 7649 userInfoEndpoint The endpoint where profile data can be retrieved. This is not part of the OAuth2 specification clientId The identifier of the client to use, see section 1.1 and 2.2 of RFC 7649 . This client is assumed to be confidential as in section 2.1 clientSecret Secret associated to the client scopes A JSON array of strings that represent the scopes of the access tokens to retrieve redirectUri Redirect URI as in section 3.1.2 of RFC 7649 clientCredsInRequestBody true indicates the client authenticates at the token endpoint by including the credentials in the body of the request, otherwise, HTTP Basic authentication is assumed. See section 2.3.1 of RFC 7649 custParamsAuthReq A JSON object (keys and values expected to be strings) with extra parameters to pass to the authorization endpoint if desired custParamsTokenReq A JSON object (keys and values expected to be strings) with extra parameters to pass to the token endpoint if desired Here is an example: { \"authzEndpoint\": \"https://www.facebook.com/v14.0/dialog/oauth\", \"tokenEndpoint\": \"https://graph.facebook.com/v14.0/oauth/access_token\", \"userInfoEndpoint\": \"https://graph.facebook.com/v14.0/me\", \"clientId\": \"90210\", \"clientSecret\": \"changeit\", \"scopes\": [\"email\", \"public_profile\"] } Attribute mappings # This is the process through which the raw user profile data received by an identity provider is transformed into an object suitable for being stored in the Janssen's user database. Here, developers have the opportunity to \"map\" or \"transform\" the incoming data to one compatible with the data types, formats, and names required by the database. As an example suppose a provider returned the following: { \"id\": dfsg2-3bui2.2.5+ld1, \"email\": \"moe@doedoe.co\", \"last_name\": \"Doe\", \"first_name\": \"Moe\" } None of this attributes exist in Janssen, database adheres to LDAP naming. Conformant names would be uid , mail , sn , and givenName . Also, let's assume you want to set displayName to a string composed by the first and last names separated by a white space. Writing a mapping is required. A mapping is implemented in Java in the form of a java.util.function.UnaryOperator<Map<String, Object>> , that is, a function that takes a Map<String, Object> as input and returns a Map<String, Object> as result. Several examples are provided here . Note property mappingClassField of every provider defined in the main flow points to the fully qualified name of a mapping. Some important considerations: A mapping has to be declared as a public field in a public class Not all mappings have to belong to the same class Several providers can use the same mapping While working on a mapping, having to pack the class in a jar file, uploading it to the server, and then restarting every time a modification is made can be a big burden. To avoid this you can upload the source (java) file to the scripts directory of Agama and leverage hot reloading as outlined here . A \"template\" for quickly start writing a mapping is already available . Save with .java extension only, edit the body of the lambda expression, upload to the server, and then update the main flow as follows: Add an instruction like Call io.jans.inbound.CustomMappings#class at the beginning of the flow body for the class to be effectively reloaded when the file is modified Set mappingClassField to io.jans.inbound.CustomMappings.SAMPLE_MAPPING for the provider of interest. You may like the idea of using a different name for the field - update the java file accordingly From there onwards, you only need to re-upload the file as many times as needed. If you use DEBUG logging level in your server, you will see in the log the result of the mapping every time it is applied. Check for a message like \"Mapped profile is\". Utility flows # A couple of utility flows are available for developers writing flows: Qualified name Source code io.jans.inbound.oauth2.AuthzCode link io.jans.inbound.oauth2.AuthzCodeWithUserInfo link Authorization Code flow ( io.jans.inbound.oauth2.AuthzCode ): This flow implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant where client authentication at the token endpoint occurs as described in section 2.3.1 of RFC 6749 (HTTP basic authentication scheme). In summary, this flow redirects the browser to the external provider's site where the user will enter his credentials, then back at the Janssen redirect URL a code is obtained which is employed to issue an access token request. The flow returns the token response as received by the provider Authorization Code flow with userInfo request ( io.jans.inbound.oauth2.AuthzCodeWithUserInfo ): This flow reuses the previous flow and additionally issues a request to a given userInfo URL passing the access token in the HTTP Authorization header. The response obtained (the profile data of the user) is returned in conjuction with the token response of the authorization code flow The above means that often, when writing a new flow for a provider, the task boils down to calling the latter flow and returning profile data only. Creating a provider flow # A provider flow must fulfil the conditions as summarized earlier . Developers have to figure out if the OAuth2 code authorization grant is supported, where the task is simplified to get the required configurations . Here, the source code flow of a flow like Facebook can be re-used - probably without modification other than in the header.","title":"Inbound identity with Agama"},{"location":"agama-catalog/jans/inboundID/#inbound-identity-with-agama","text":"Using Agama administrators can delegate authorization to external services like social sites.

Developers are free to choose what fits best for their needs. Also note provider flows must not receive any inputs: the main flow won't pass any arguments when triggering them. Thus, design your flows so there is no use of Inputs but Configs directive in the header . In practice many identity providers adhere to the OAuth2 code grant, so you can re-use the structure represented by this Java class for the purpose. Particularly, the already implemented flows (like Facebook) use it for their configuration. The table below explains the meaning of its properties: Name Description authzEndpoint The authorization endpoint as in section 3.1 of RFC 7649 tokenEndpoint The token endpoint as in section 3.2 of RFC 7649 userInfoEndpoint The endpoint where profile data can be retrieved.

See section 2.3.1 of RFC 7649 custParamsAuthReq A JSON object (keys and values expected to be strings) with extra parameters to pass to the authorization endpoint if desired custParamsTokenReq A JSON object (keys and values expected to be strings) with extra parameters to pass to the token endpoint if desired Here is an example: { \"authzEndpoint\": \"https://www.facebook.com/v14.0/dialog/oauth\", \"tokenEndpoint\": \"https://graph.facebook.com/v14.0/oauth/access_token\", \"userInfoEndpoint\": \"https://graph.facebook.com/v14.0/me\", \"clientId\": \"90210\", \"clientSecret\": \"changeit\", \"scopes\": [\"email\", \"public_profile\"] }","title":"Provider flow configurations"},{"location":"agama-catalog/jans/inboundID/#attribute-mappings","text":"This is the process through which the raw user profile data received by an identity provider is transformed into an object suitable for being stored in the Janssen's user database. Here, developers have the opportunity to \"map\" or \"transform\" the incoming data to one compatible with the data types, formats, and names required by the database. As an example suppose a provider returned the following: { \"id\": dfsg2-3bui2.2.5+ld1, \"email\": \"moe@doedoe.co\", \"last_name\": \"Doe\", \"first_name\": \"Moe\" } None of this attributes exist in Janssen, database adheres to LDAP naming. Conformant names would be uid , mail , sn , and givenName . Also, let's assume you want to set displayName to a string composed by the first and last names separated by a white space. Writing a mapping is required. A mapping is implemented in Java in the form of a java.util.function.UnaryOperator<Map<String, Object>> , that is, a function that takes a Map<String, Object> as input and returns a Map<String, Object> as result. Several examples are provided here . Note property mappingClassField of every provider defined in the main flow points to the fully qualified name of a mapping. Some important considerations: A mapping has to be declared as a public field in a public class Not all mappings have to belong to the same class Several providers can use the same mapping While working on a mapping, having to pack the class in a jar file, uploading it to the server, and then restarting every time a modification is made can be a big burden. To avoid this you can upload the source (java) file to the scripts directory of Agama and leverage hot reloading as outlined here . A \"template\" for quickly start writing a mapping is already available . Save with .java extension only, edit the body of the lambda expression, upload to the server, and then update the main flow as follows: Add an instruction like Call io.jans.inbound.CustomMappings#class at the beginning of the flow body for the class to be effectively reloaded when the file is modified Set mappingClassField to io.jans.inbound.CustomMappings.SAMPLE_MAPPING for the provider of interest. You may like the idea of using a different name for the field - update the java file accordingly From there onwards, you only need to re-upload the file as many times as needed. If you use DEBUG logging level in your server, you will see in the log the result of the mapping every time it is applied. Check for a message like \"Mapped profile is\".","title":"Attribute mappings"},{"location":"agama-catalog/jans/inboundID/#utility-flows","text":"A couple of utility flows are available for developers writing flows: Qualified name Source code io.jans.inbound.oauth2.AuthzCode link io.jans.inbound.oauth2.AuthzCodeWithUserInfo link Authorization Code flow ( io.jans.inbound.oauth2.AuthzCode ): This flow implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant where client authentication at the token endpoint occurs as described in section 2.3.1 of RFC 6749 (HTTP basic authentication scheme). In summary, this flow redirects the browser to the external provider's site where the user will enter his credentials, then back at the Janssen redirect URL a code is obtained which is employed to issue an access token request. The flow returns the token response as received by the provider Authorization Code flow with userInfo request ( io.jans.inbound.oauth2.AuthzCodeWithUserInfo ): This flow reuses the previous flow and additionally issues a request to a given userInfo URL passing the access token in the HTTP Authorization header. The response obtained (the profile data of the user) is returned in conjuction with the token response of the authorization code flow The above means that often, when writing a new flow for a provider, the task boils down to calling the latter flow and returning profile data only.","title":"Utility flows"},{"location":"agama-catalog/jans/inboundID/#creating-a-provider-flow","text":"A provider flow must fulfil the conditions as summarized earlier .

Hence, like any other Java process the module JVMs can be configured to open a debug port where a remote debugger can be attached. The steps below will show how to configure auth-server module for remote debugging. Pass the command-line options to the JVM On the Janssen Server host, open the service config file /etc/default/jans-auth and add the following JVM parameters to as JAVA_OPTIONS ``` -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=6001 ``` This will open port 6001 for the remote debugger. Any other port can also be used based on availability. Restart jans-auth services systemctl restart jans-auth.service Check if the port is open and accessible from within the Janssen Server host Use the jdb tool from JDK to test if the JVM port has been opened ``` ./<path-to-JDK>/bin/jdb -attach 6001 ``` if the port is open, it'll give you output like the below: ``` Set uncaught java.lang.Throwable Set deferred uncaught java.lang.Throwable Initializing jdb ... > ``` press ctrl+c to come out of it. Ensure that the port is accessible from outside the host VM as well and firewalls are configured accordingly Connect to the remote port on the Janssen Server host from the Janssen workspace. Use any IDE (Intellij, Eclipse, etc.) to create and run a remote debugging profile providing IP and debug port of the Janssen Server host.

Janssen's FIDO2 server - a component inside the Janssen project enables users of RPs to enroll and authenticate themselves using U2F keys, FIDO2 keys or inbuilt platform authenticator. 1. The FIDO2 server uses REST endpoints to communicate with an RP via an https connection. 2. The FIDO2 server implements the FIDO Metadata Service (MDS3) defined by FIDO Alliance. 3. The FIDO2 server stores user data into the same persistence store as the Jans-Auth server. (LDAP, MYSQL, Couchbase etc.) Components of the FIDO2 ecosystem in Janssen # Diagram reference User : User of an application, the one who possesses the Authenticator and who's role is to pass the Test of User Presence (TUP) (touch device, look, speak etc.). WebAuthn API : A global web standard for password-less FIDO2 authentication, implemented by most browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, Opera, Microsoft edge). It provides clients access to the underlying capabilities of the Authenticator. WebAuthn offers a very good user experience, there is no need for any additional browser plugin to be installed.

LF Projects, LLC (\u201cLF Projects\u201d) is a Delaware series limited liability company. All contributors (including committers, maintainers, and other technical positions) and other participants in the Project (collectively, \u201cCollaborators\u201d) must comply with the terms of this Charter. Mission and Scope of the Project The mission of the Project is to develop and maintain a cloud native identity and authorization platform that comprehensively implements OAuth, OpenID Connect and the User Managed Access protocol, while maintaining flexibility and horizontal scalability. The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project. Technical Steering Committee The Technical Steering Committee (the \u201cTSC\u201d) will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project. The TSC voting members are initially the Project\u2019s Committers. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the \u201cCONTRIBUTING\u201d file within the Project\u2019s code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person. TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Unless otherwise documented: Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project; Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (\u201ccommit\u201d) source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project\u2019s repository; and A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter. The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit. The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC. Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include: coordinating the technical direction of the Project; approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project\u2019s scope); organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects; creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements; appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities; establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies; approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the series manager of the Project (as provided for in the Series Agreement, the \u201cSeries Manager\u201d) to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter; discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project. TSC Voting While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis. Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting. Except as provided in Section 7.iii. and 8.i, decisions by vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met. Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote of all voting members of the TSC. In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the TSC, any voting member of the TSC may refer the matter to the Series Manager for assistance in reaching a resolution. Compliance with Policies This Charter is subject to the Series Agreement for the Project and the Operating Agreement of LF Projects. Contributors will comply with the policies of LF Projects as may be adopted and amended by LF Projects, including, without limitation the policies listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies/. The TSC may adopt a code of conduct (\u201cCoC\u201d) for the Project, which is subject to approval by the Series Manager. In the event that a Project-specific CoC has not been approved, the LF Projects Code of Conduct listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies will apply for all Collaborators in the Project. When amending or adopting any policy applicable to the Project, LF Projects will publish such policy, as to be amended or adopted, on its web site at least 30 days prior to such policy taking effect; provided, however, that in the case of any amendment of the Trademark Policy or Terms of Use of LF Projects, any such amendment is effective upon publication on LF Project\u2019s web site. All Collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted for all Collaborators by the TSC, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the Project community must not seek to exclude any participant based on any criteria, requirement, or reason other than those that are reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all Collaborators in the Project community. The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative, and ethical manner at all times. The output of all Project discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions, and status should be made open and easily visible to all. Any potential violations of this requirement should be reported immediately to the Series Manager. Community Assets LF Projects will hold title to all trade or service marks used by the Project (\u201cProject Trademarks\u201d), whether based on common law or registered rights. Project Trademarks will be transferred and assigned to LF Projects to hold on behalf of the Project.

Whether a project uses a DCO or a CLA, the original copyright holders retain their copyrights. Copyright Notices # The Janssen Project does not require or recommend that every contributor include their copyright notice in contributed files. See below for more details on why not. Instead, we recommend using a more general statement in a form similar to the following: Copyright The Janssen Project Authors. Copyright The Janssen Project Contributors. Copyright Contributors to the Janssen Project. These statements are intended to communicate the following: - the work is copyrighted; - the contributors of the code licensed it, but retain ownership of their copyrights; and - it was licensed for distribution as part of the named project. By using a common format, the project avoids having to deal with names of copyright holders, years or ranges of years, and variations on the (c) symbol. This aims to minimize the burden on developers and maintainers as well as redistributors of the code. What if I want my copyright notice included? # Please note that it is not wrong , and it is acceptable, if a contributor wishes to keep their own copyright notices on their contributions. The above is a recommended format for ease of use, but is not mandated by the Janssen Project. If you are contributing on behalf of your employer, you may wish to discuss with your legal department about whether they will require you to include a copyright notice identifying them as the copyright holder in contributions. What about Third Party Code? # If a file only contains code that originates from a third party source who didn't contribute it themselves, then you would not want to add the notices above. (In a similar vein, you wouldn't add a notice identifying you as the copyright holder either, if you didn't own it.) Just preserve the existing copyright and license notices as they are.

This includes third parties' notices in pre-existing code. Why not list every copyright holder? # There are several reasons why the Janssen Project doesn't require or recommend trying to list every copyright holder for contributions to every file: Copyright notices are not mandatory in order for the contributor to retain ownership of their copyright. Copyright notices are rarely kept up to date as a file evolves, resulting in inaccurate statements. Trying to keep notices up to date, or to correct notices that have become inaccurate, increases the burden on developers without tangible benefit. Developers and maintainers often do not want to have to worry about e.g. whether a minor contribution (such as a typo fix) means that a new copyright notice should be added.

Aim is to determine characteristics of new PRs/issues and take quick actions if possible. Triage process is a contineous process. As new issues/PRs come in, the community initiates discussions, add labels, ask for more details. This process does not wait for triage call or a meeting to be called. Community holds triage calls at a regular cadence. Triage calls are mainly utilised to discuss issue/PR where concensus is not yet reached and to pick up anything which is not yet triaged.

During client registration, custom interception scripts can be used to implement custom business logic. For instance, data could be validated, extra client claims could be populated, scopes could be modified, or APIs could be called to determine whether the client should get registered at all. Configuration Prerequisites # A Janssen Authorization Server installation Client Registration script - included in the default Janssen OpenBanking distribution Setting configuration parameters Setting third party library (Jose4j) in classpath Adding the custom script # To add or update custom scripts, you can use either jans-cli or curl. jans-cli in interactive mode, option 13 enables you manage custom scripts. For more info, see the docs . jans-cli in command line argument mode is more conducive to scripting and automation. To display the available operations for custom scripts, use config-cli.py --info CustomScripts. See the docs for more info. To use curl see these docs Note You can normally find jans-cli.py in the /opt/jans/jans-cli/ folder. Configuring keys, certificates and SSA validation endpoints # The client registration custom script will use configuration parameters like SSA Validation endpoint, JWKS endpoints, keystores, trust stores etc which are listed in the tabular format below.

They are by their very nature, unguessable strings that meet the prescribed OAuth security guidelines for lack of order or predictability (entropy).

Access token data is essential for the resource server to evaluate policies that determine whether or not to allow the request. Token introspection therefore enables a client to trade an OAuth reference token for its JSON equivalent by making a request per OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection Guide - (RFC 7662) . The use of Introspection scripts allows the ability to modify the response of Introspection Endpoint spec and provide additional information in the JSON response.

The Janssen server includes a FIDO2 server implementation. This enables authentications by using platform authenticators embedded into a person's device or physical USB, NFC or Bluetooth security keys that are inserted into a USB slot of a computer. FIDO2 is comprised of the W3C\u2019s Web Authentication specification (WebAuthn) and FIDO\u2019s corresponding Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) . WebAuthn defines a standard web API that can be built into browsers and related web platform infrastructure to enable online services to use FIDO Authentication. CTAP enables external devices such as mobile handsets or FIDO Security Keys to work with WebAuthn and serve as authenticators to desktop applications and web services. This document explains how to use the Janssen Auth Server's built-in FIDO2 interception script to implement a two-step, two-factor authentication (2FA) with username / password as the first step, and any FIDO2 device as the second step.

Create a new intermediate-ca.conf file: # [ ca ] default_ca = gluuca [ crl_ext ] issuerAltName=issuer:copy authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid:always [ gluuca ] dir = ./ new_certs_dir = $dir unique_subject = no certificate = $dir/intermediate1.crt database = $dir/certindex private_key = $dir/intermediate1.key serial = $dir/certserial default_days = 365 default_md = sha1 policy = gluuca_policy x509_extensions = gluuca_extensions crlnumber = $dir/crlnumber default_crl_days = 365 [ gluuca_policy ] commonName = supplied stateOrProvinceName = supplied countryName = optional emailAddress = optional organizationName = supplied organizationalUnitName = optional [ gluuca_extensions ] basicConstraints = critical,CA:FALSE keyUsage = critical,any subjectKeyIdentifier = hash authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth crlDistributionPoints = @crl_section subjectAltName = @alt_names authorityInfoAccess = @ocsp_section [alt_names] DNS.0 = example.com DNS.1 = example.org [crl_section] URI.0 = http://pki.gluu.org/GluuIntermidiate1.crl URI.1 = http://pki.backup.com/GluuIntermidiate1.crl [ocsp_section] caIssuers;URI.0 = http://pki.gluu.org/GluuIntermediate1.crt caIssuers;URI.1 = http://pki.backup.com/GluuIntermediate1.crt OCSP;URI.0 = http://pki.gluu.org/ocsp/ OCSP;URI.1 = http://pki.backup.com/ocsp/ Change the [alt_names] section to whatever you need as Subject Alternative names. Remove it including the subjectAltName = @alt_names line if you don't want a Subject Alternative Name. If you need to set a specific certificate start / expiry date, add the following to [gluuca] # format: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS default_enddate = 20191222035911 default_startdate = 20181222035911 Generate an empty CRL (both in PEM and DER): openssl ca -config intermediate-ca.conf -gencrl -keyfile intermediate1.key -cert intermediate1.crt -out intermediate1.crl.pem openssl crl -inform PEM -in intermediate1.crl.pem -outform DER -out intermediate1.crl 2.7. This is sample to show how to revoke cert. Use it only when you need to revoke the intermediate cert: # openssl ca -config root-ca.conf -revoke intermediate1.crt -keyfile rootca.key -cert rootca.crt 3. Creating end user certificates # We use this new intermediate CA to generate an end user certificate. Repeat these steps for every end user certificate you want to sign with this CA. 3.1. Create folder for end user certs: # mkdir enduser-certs 3.2. Generate the end user's private key: # openssl genrsa -out enduser-certs/user-gluu.org.key 4096 3.3. Generate the end user's CSR: # openssl req -new -sha256 -key enduser-certs/user-gluu.org.key -out enduser-certs/user-gluu.org.csr Example output: You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request. What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN. There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank For some fields there will be a default value, If you enter '.', the field will be left blank. ----- Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:TX Locality Name (eg, city) []:Austin Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Gluu, Inc. Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:User Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Full User Name Email Address []: Please enter the following 'extra' attributes to be sent with your certificate request A challenge password []: An optional company name []: 3.4. Sign the end user's CSR with the Intermediate 1 CA: # openssl ca -batch -config intermediate-ca.conf -notext -in enduser-certs/user-gluu.org.csr -out enduser-certs/user-gluu.org.crt Example output: Using configuration from intermediate-ca.conf Check that the request matches the signature Signature ok The Subject's Distinguished Name is as follows countryName :PRINTABLE:'US' stateOrProvinceName :ASN.1 12:'TX' localityName :ASN.1 12:'Austin' organizationName :ASN.1 12:'Gluu, Inc.' organizationalUnitName:ASN.1 12:'User' commonName :ASN.1 12:'Full User Name' Certificate is to be certified until Dec 22 08:07:15 2020 GMT (365 days) Write out database with 1 new entries Data Base Updated 3.5. Generate the CRL (both in PEM and DER): # openssl ca -config intermediate-ca.conf -gencrl -keyfile intermediate1.key -cert intermediate1.crt -out intermediate1.crl.pem openssl crl -inform PEM -in intermediate1.crl.pem -outform DER -out intermediate1.crl Generate the CRL after every certificate you sign with the CA. 3.6. Create the certificate chain file by concatenating the Root and intermediate 1 certificates together. # cat ../rootca.crt intermediate1.crt > enduser-certs/user-gluu.org.chain Send the following files to the end user: user-gluu.org.crt user-gluu.org.key user-gluu.org.chain You can also let the end user supply their own CSR and just send them the .crt file. Do not delete that from the server, otherwise you cannot revoke it. 3.7. This is sample to show how to revoke cert. Use it only when you need to revoke the end users cert: # openssl ca -config intermediate-ca.conf -revoke enduser-certs/enduser-gluu.org.crt -keyfile intermediate1.key -cert intermediate1.crt 4. Validating the certificate # 4.1. You can validate the end user certificate against the chain using the following command: # openssl verify -CAfile enduser-certs/user-gluu.org.chain enduser-certs/user-gluu.org.crt Example output: enduser-certs/user-gluu.org.crt: OK 4.2. You can also validate it against the CRL. Concatenate the PEM CRL and the chain together first: # cat ../rootca.crt intermediate1.crt intermediate1.crl.pem > enduser-certs/user-gluu.org.crl.chain Verify the certificate: openssl verify -crl_check -CAfile enduser-certs/user-gluu.org.crl.chain enduser-certs/user-gluu.org.crt Example output: enduser-certs/user-gluu.org.crt: OK 5.

Gluu Server is a container distribution of free open source software (FOSS) for identity and access management (IAM). Gluu Server combines SAML 2.0, LDAP, OpenID Connect, and other authentication and authorization protocol implementations to create a platform for user authentication, identity information, and policy decisions. Combining WWPass strong multi-factor authentication with the versatility of Gluu Server helps to build secure IAM solutions that can be used for single sign-on (SSO), customer identity and access management (CIAM), and identity federation. Prerequisites # This tutorial assumes that you have the following: Gluu Server 4.1.1 installed on Ubuntu Server 18.04 or 16.04; An administrative account on this Ubuntu Server; An application certificate and private key for WWPass authentication; WWPass Key app or hardware token; Obtain Application Certificate and Private Key From WWPass # To obtain an application certificate and private key go to wwpass.com , click Sign Up to create a developer account or Log In if you already have an account. Then follow the website instructions to register your application domain and issue the application certificate. Prepare WWPass Integration Files # Copy this directory to your Gluu server and make it current cd wwpass Files in pages directory should be deployed to /opt/gluu-server/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/custom/pages/ sudo cp -rL pages/* /opt/gluu-server/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/custom/pages/ Files in static directory should be deployed to /opt/gluu-server/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/custom/static/ sudo cp -rL pages/* /opt/gluu-server/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/custom/static/ Copy wwpass.py to /opt/gluu-server/opt/gluu/python/libs/ sudo cp wwpass.py /opt/gluu-server/opt/gluu/python/libs/ Copy ticket.json to /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/cgi sudo mkdir -p /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/cgi sudo cp ticket.json /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/cgi Make sure ticket.json is executable sudo chmod 755 /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/cgi/ticket.json Copy WWPass application certificate and private key to /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/ (assuming the certificate and key files are in your home directory) sudo cp ~/gluu_client.crt /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/gluu_client.crt sudo cp ~/gluu_client.key /opt/gluu-server/opt/wwpass_gluu/gluu_client.key Replace ~/gluu_client.crt and ~/gluu_client.key with the names and location of your certificate and key files.

Do not add this property otherwise recovery_url: URL for account recovery, if you have one. Do not add this property otherwise. To require PIN or biometrics during login, add: use_pin: True To enable binding WWPass keys with email, add: allow_email_bind: True Note, your Gluu server should be able to send emails, see Configuration -> Organization configuration -> SMTP Server Configuration . To enable binding WWPass keys with existing usernames and passwords, add: allow_password_bind: True To enable binding WWPass keys with another WWPass key, add: allow_passkey_bind: True Replace the content of Script textbox with the content of wwpassauth.py from gluu-master Set Enabled checkbox to enable the custom script: Click the Update button. It's also recommended to increase the unauthenticated session lifetime to give users more time to bind their WWPass keys. Go to Configuration -> JSON configuration -> OxAuth Configuration , find sessionIdUnauthenticatedUnusedLifetime setting and set it to 600 or more. Click Update to save settings. Set up Authentication Method # Before switching to WWPass authentication, make sure you have opened an administrator session in a different browser (not in a different window, but a completely different browser). Do not close that browser window and reload it from time to time to make sure your session does not expire. Keep the backup session opened until you are sure that WWPass authentication works properly or you might lock yourself out of Gluu. If that happens, refer to: Gluu FAQ In the Gluu Admin interface, navigate to Configuration -> Manage Authentication -> Default Authentication Method . Set both options to \"wwpass\". Click Update to save settings. Test Your Setup # Open \"https:// /\" in a different browser (not the one you used to configure Gluu). Try to sign in to your Gluu server with WWPass and bind your key using either email or username and password. If something does not work as expected, return to your main browser and revert Configuration -> Manage Authentication -> Default Authentication Method back to auth_ldap_server while you troubleshoot the problem. Troubleshooting # Relevant Gluu log files are: /opt/gluu-server/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/logs/oxauth.log /opt/gluu-server/opt/gluu/jetty/oxauth/logs/oxauth_script.log Check the files above for any errors. Errors in wwpass interception script are also displayed in Gluu web interface at 'Configuration -> Manage Custom scripts'. If there are any errors in the script, its name will be in red and the script editor will display the red button named \"Show Error\".

Combining WWPass strong multi-factor authentication with the versatility of Gluu Server helps to build secure IAM solutions that can be used for single sign-on (SSO), customer identity and access management (CIAM), and identity federation.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"script-catalog/person_authentication/other/wwpass/INSTALLATION/#prerequisites","text":"This tutorial assumes that you have the following: Gluu Server 4.1.1 installed on Ubuntu Server 18.04 or 16.04; An administrative account on this Ubuntu Server; An application certificate and private key for WWPass authentication; WWPass Key app or hardware token;","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"script-catalog/person_authentication/other/wwpass/INSTALLATION/#obtain-application-certificate-and-private-key-from-wwpass","text":"To obtain an application certificate and private key go to wwpass.com , click Sign Up to create a developer account or Log In if you already have an account.

To enable Super Gluu as an authentication method, follow the steps below: Obtain the json contents of super_gluu custom script by using a jans-cli command like get-config-scripts-by-type , get-config-scripts-by-inum etc. e.g : /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id get-config-scripts-by-type --url-suffix type:PERSON_AUTHENTICATION , /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id get-config-scripts-by-inum --url-suffix inum:6122281b-b55d-4dd0-8115-b098eeeee2b7 Update the custom script and change the enabled attribute to true Now Sign-in with Super-Gluu is an available authentication mechanism for your Janssen Server. This means that, using OpenID Connect acr_values, applications can now request Super-Gluu authentication for users. !!! Note To make sure super_gluu has been enabled successfully, you can check your Janssen's Auth Server OpenID Connect configuration by navigating to the following URL: https:// /.well-known/openid-configuration. Find \"acr_values_supported\": and you should see \"super_gluu\". Make Sign-in with Super-Gluu Script as default authentication script: # Use this link as a reference. Steps: 1. Create a file say sg-auth-default.json with the following contents { \"defaultAcr\": \"super_gluu\" } 2.Update the default authentication method to super_gluu /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id put-acrs --data /tmp/sg-auth-default.json Test the feature # To test, enter the complete URL for authorization in a browser or create a simple webpage with a link that simulates the user sign-in attempt.

With SCIM scripts, custom business logic can be executed when several of the SCIM API operations are invoked. This is useful in many situations, for example: Trigger notifications to external systems when certain resources are deleted Alter the actual responses the service produces Attach additional information to resources when they are created or updated Implement a fine-grained level of access to resources so different callers have permission to handle only a restricted number of resources Notes: # In this document, the term resources refer to those \"entities\" the service can manage, for instance, users or groups The term operation refers to any SCIM functionality accessible through its HTTP endpoints Basic development skills are assumed. Some grasp of Java and Python are required as well as understanding of the SCIM protocol. Interface # Methods # API Overview Custom scripts adhere to a simple API (ie. a well-defined collection of methods/routines) that is described in the following. It is advised to check the dummy script provided here as you read this section. Scripts' config properties All methods contain a configurationAttributes parameter, this gives access to the configuration properties of the script itself. This is a relevant aspect of Gluu scripts: they are all parameterizable!. configurationAttributes is a java.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty> and here is how SimpleCustomProperty looks. Basic Methods These are methods not related to SCIM operations but still play key roles: |Method Name|Description|Return Value| |:---|:---|:---| | init |Called when the (SCIM) service starts and every time the script properties or code changes|A boolean value describing success or failure| | destroy |Called every time the script properties or code changes (called before init )|A boolean value describing success or failure| | getApiVersion |Determines what methods are effectively called when SCIM endpoints are invoked|A positive integer| Pre-resource Modification They are called when the resource is about to be persisted. The second parameter in these methods hold the object that will be persisted to permanent storage, thus any change or manipulation upon the object will be reflected in the underlying database (as well as in the output of the SCIM operation call itself). These methods are called regardless of the API version used. Names are self explanatory: Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link createUser , updateUser , deleteUser user ScimCustomPerson createGroup , updateGroup , deleteGroup group GluuGroup Pre-resource modification methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the corresponding SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Note that update* methods are called for both SCIM PUT and PATCH operations. Post-resource Modification They are called after the resource is persisted. The second parameter in these methods hold the object that was saved. Any change or manipulation upon the object will not be reflected in the underlying database, but may still modify the service response. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 2. Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link postCreateUser , postUpdateUser , postDeleteUser user ScimCustomPerson postCreateGroup , postUpdateGroup , postDeleteGroup group GluuGroup Post-resource modification methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the corresponding SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Note that postUpdate* methods are called for both SCIM PUT and PATCH operations. Single Resource Retrieval These apply for SCIM operations that retrieve a resource by ID. They are called after the resource has been obtained from the database. The second parameter in these methods hold a reference to such object. Any change or manipulation upon the object will not be reflected in the underlying database, but may still modify the service response. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 3. Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link getUser user ScimCustomPerson getGroup group GluuGroup Single resource retrieval methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the whole SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Multiple Resources Retrieval These apply for SCIM search operations. They are called after the results have been obtained from the database. The second parameter in these methods hold a reference to such result set. Any change or manipulation upon the object will not be reflected in the underlying database, but may still modify the service response. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 4. Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link postSearchUsers results PagedResult postSearchGroups results PagedResult Multiple resources retrieval methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the whole SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Note that searching using the root .search SCIM endpoint will trigger calls to both of the methods listed. Advanced control These are alternative methods that allow to tweak the response the service produces. They can be employed to introduce complex business rules when operations are executed. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 5. Methods manageResourceOperation manageSearchOperation Example: Modifying Search Results # SCIM spec defines the concept of attribute returnability where some attributes should never be part of a response (like passwords), always be returned (like resource identifiers), or be returned by default unless otherwise stated by the excludedAttributes parameter. Assume you are maintaining a user base of secret agents that work for your company and need to avoid exposing information such as their physical addresses for safety reasons. To keep it simple let's restrict the scope to user searches only. In practice you should take steps to hide this data on user retrieval and update. Let's alter postSearchUsers 's second parameter ( results ) to ensure addresses are not leaked: for user in results . getEntries () : user . setAttribute ( \"jansAddres\" , None ) This is very straightforward code except for the usage of jansAddres . Shouldn't it be simply addresses as the known SCIM attribute? Scripts work with entities that are about to be persisted or have already been saved so they kind of resemble the database structure (schema in LDAP terms). It turns out that database attribute names rarely match with SCIM names. While it is easy to know the SCIM name of a database attribute, the converse requires checking the code, however since you already have the skill this shouldn't be a problem: in this Java class you'll find the representation of a user resource in SCIM spec terms. Pay attention to the addresses field and its associated StoreReference annotation that contains the attribute where addresses are actually stored. With that said, save your modifications. You may like the idea of adding some prints for enlightment like: print \"%d entries returned of %d\" % ( results . getEntriesCount () , results . getTotalEntriesCount ()) for user in results . getEntries () : print \"Flushing addresses for user %s\" % user . getUid () user . setAttribute ( \"jansAddres\" , None ) Ensure no addresses are returned anymore in your SCIM user searches. Happy testing! Controlling execution of SCIM operations # With the manageResourceOperation and manageSearchOperation methods you can make complex decisions on how processing should take place based on contextual data and the incoming payload. manageResourceOperation This method is invoked when any following operations are executed: resource creation, modification, removal and retrieval by ID. In case of bulks, the method is called for every operation that fits into these categories. Parameters are described in the table below: Name Description Class/Link context Provides contextual information about the SCIM operation being called such as type of resource involved, HTTP verb, request headers, query params, etc. OperationContext entity A non-null object representing the resource involved A descendant of Entry . If the resource is a user, it will be an instance of ScimCustomPerson . In case of a group, it will be a GluuGroup payload The payload sent in the invocation; null when the operation is removal or retrieval by ID The datatype depends on the operation called. Check the interface that suits best and inspect the first parameter's datatype. The class will belong to some subpackage inside io.jans.scim.model.scim2 This method is expected to return an instance of javax.ws.rs.core.Response that supersedes the output of the operation itself. In other words, the actual processing of the operation is skipped in favor of the code supplied here. However note that minor validations may take place in the payload before your code is actually called. Returning None transfers the control of the operation for normal processing (default Jans implementation). If the method execution crashes at runtime, a 500 HTTP error is sent. Notes: Possible values for context.getResourceType() are: User, Group, FidoDevice, Fido2Device context.getTokenDetails().getValue() is a shortcut that will give you the access token the caller employed to issue the service call Both context.getTokenDetails().getTokenType() and context.getTokenDetails().getScope() return non null values when the protection mechanism of the API is OAuth or test mode Note that for resource creation operation, entity basically contains the same data supplied in the POST payload . In this case, entity has not originated from the database and has not been persisted either For the case of modification, retrieval and removal, entity contains the data currently stored in the database for the resource in question Since many values come from Java code, you can always do getClass().getName() to get an idea of what type of variables you are dealing with To build custom error responses your can reuse some of the getErrorResponse methods of class BaseScimWebService This method offers a high degree of flexibility. Perform careful testing of your code and account all potential scenarios. manageSearchOperation This method is invoked when resource searches are performed. Parameters are described in the table below: name Description Class/Link context Provides contextual information about the SCIM operation being called such as type of resource involved, HTTP verb, request headers, query params, etc. OperationContext searchRequest An object representing the search parameters provided in the call (applies for both GET and POST) SearchRequest Unlike manageResourceOperation , no entity parameter is passed. This is so because making decisions based on already executed searches would have a performance impact. Instead you can use context.setFilterPrepend(...) to help restrict the search against the database: here you can pass a String value that will be interpreted as an SCIM filter expression (see section 3.4.2.2 of RFC 7644). When the search being performed already contains a search filter (i.e. searchRequest.getFilter() is non-empty), a new filter is created by appending both \"subfilters\" with an and operator. As in the case of manageResourceOperation this method is expected to return an instance of javax.ws.rs.core.Response . Returning None transfers the control of the operation for normal processing (the Jans implementation). If the method execution crashes at runtime, a 500 HTTP error is sent. The same recommendations given for manageResourceOperation apply here. If you build filter expressions in your method, ensure they are syntactically valid to avoid your callers getting unexpected \"invalidFilter\" 400 errors. Example: segmenting the user base Let's assume you make use of the SCIM attribute userType so that your user base is partitioned into three disjoint segments according to such attribute and you have designated its possible values to be: Contractor, Employee, or Intern. Suppose your company has three different applications that make management of users in every category, that is, only one application is devoted to manage contractors, another employees, and other interns. You are interested in consistently granting access so that no application can create, query or modify users that don't belong to its focus. To properly handle this multi-tenancy scenario, you decide to use the contextual information coming from every request to determine if the operation should be allowed or not. For this purpose you communicate every application developer to send an additional HTTP header in their call with a value that only you (the administrator) and the developer knows. Let's call it the \"secret\". For the sake of simplicity let's assume developers are external to the company and only you know their identities. They don't know each other so they cannot exchange secrets. The strategy to implement segmentation is rather simple: Alter the default SCIM script by supplying a custom implementation for the methods that control execution Make the HTTP header name be a configuration property of the script so that it is not hard-coded Add a configuration property that contains the mapping of userType value vs. expected header value in JSON format Adding and parsing config properties Using Jans Config CLI update the SCIM script and add properties: custom_header with value USER-SEGMENT-SECRET access_map with value { \"<random_string>\":\"Contractor\", \"<random_string>\":\"Employee\", \"<random_string>\":\"Intern\" } Save the changes. In the init method this properties should be parsed. To start, let's add some imports: from io.jans.scim.ws.rs.scim2 import BaseScimWebService import json Here is how init would look like: def init ( self , configurationAttributes ): self . custom_header = configurationAttributes . get ( \"custom_header\" ) . getValue2 () access_map_json = configurationAttributes . get ( \"access_map\" ) . getValue2 () self . access_map = json . loads ( access_map_json ) print \"ScimEventHandler (init): Initialized successfully\" return True Note no validations took place here: we assumed the script contains the properties, that they are non empty and have sensible values. Allow/Deny resource operations The first step is to know the kind of application that is calling our service. For this purpose let's create a method that given incoming request headers returns the matching userType # headers params is an instance of javax . ws . rs . core . MultivaluedMap < String , String > def getUserType ( self , headers ) : secret = headers . getFirst ( self . custom_header ) if secret in self . access_map : return self . access_map [ secret ] else : return None Now let's code manageResourceOperation . We should allow access only under the following conditions: The getUserType method does not return None The entity object ( ScimCustomPerson instance) has a proper userType value. This means that for user creation, the incoming payload comes with a matching userType and for the other cases, the already stored attribute matches as well Assume that if the operation invoked is not user-related, we should allow access freely. Here is how the implementation might look: def manageResourceOperation ( self , context , entity , payload , configurationAttributes ): print \"manageResourceOperation. SCIM endpoint invoked is %s (HTTP %s )\" % ( context . getPath (), context . getMethod ()) if context . getResourceType () != \"User\" : return None expected_user_type = self . getUserType ( context . getRequestHeaders ()) if expected_user_type != None and entity . getAttribute ( \"jansUsrTyp\" ) == expected_user_type : return None else : return BaseScimWebService . getErrorResponse ( 403 , None , \"Attempt to handle a not allowed user type\" ) Note no usage of the payload took place. A case you may like to evaluate is where mistakenly using an update operation, the userType is set to an unexpected value. Allow/Deny searches This time instead of inspecting an entity, we ought to make a filter expression to restrict the search when the database is queried.

It is advised to check the dummy script provided here as you read this section. Scripts' config properties All methods contain a configurationAttributes parameter, this gives access to the configuration properties of the script itself. This is a relevant aspect of Gluu scripts: they are all parameterizable!. configurationAttributes is a java.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty> and here is how SimpleCustomProperty looks. Basic Methods These are methods not related to SCIM operations but still play key roles: |Method Name|Description|Return Value| |:---|:---|:---| | init |Called when the (SCIM) service starts and every time the script properties or code changes|A boolean value describing success or failure| | destroy |Called every time the script properties or code changes (called before init )|A boolean value describing success or failure| | getApiVersion |Determines what methods are effectively called when SCIM endpoints are invoked|A positive integer| Pre-resource Modification They are called when the resource is about to be persisted. The second parameter in these methods hold the object that will be persisted to permanent storage, thus any change or manipulation upon the object will be reflected in the underlying database (as well as in the output of the SCIM operation call itself). These methods are called regardless of the API version used. Names are self explanatory: Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link createUser , updateUser , deleteUser user ScimCustomPerson createGroup , updateGroup , deleteGroup group GluuGroup Pre-resource modification methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the corresponding SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Note that update* methods are called for both SCIM PUT and PATCH operations. Post-resource Modification They are called after the resource is persisted. The second parameter in these methods hold the object that was saved. Any change or manipulation upon the object will not be reflected in the underlying database, but may still modify the service response. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 2. Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link postCreateUser , postUpdateUser , postDeleteUser user ScimCustomPerson postCreateGroup , postUpdateGroup , postDeleteGroup group GluuGroup Post-resource modification methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the corresponding SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Note that postUpdate* methods are called for both SCIM PUT and PATCH operations. Single Resource Retrieval These apply for SCIM operations that retrieve a resource by ID. They are called after the resource has been obtained from the database. The second parameter in these methods hold a reference to such object. Any change or manipulation upon the object will not be reflected in the underlying database, but may still modify the service response. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 3. Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link getUser user ScimCustomPerson getGroup group GluuGroup Single resource retrieval methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the whole SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Multiple Resources Retrieval These apply for SCIM search operations. They are called after the results have been obtained from the database. The second parameter in these methods hold a reference to such result set. Any change or manipulation upon the object will not be reflected in the underlying database, but may still modify the service response. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 4. Methods 2nd param 2nd param Class/Link postSearchUsers results PagedResult postSearchGroups results PagedResult Multiple resources retrieval methods return a boolean. A False value aborts the whole SCIM operation and a 500 error is returned. The same applies if the method execution crashes at runtime. Note that searching using the root .search SCIM endpoint will trigger calls to both of the methods listed. Advanced control These are alternative methods that allow to tweak the response the service produces. They can be employed to introduce complex business rules when operations are executed. These methods are called if getApiVersion returns a number >= 5.

Assume you are maintaining a user base of secret agents that work for your company and need to avoid exposing information such as their physical addresses for safety reasons. To keep it simple let's restrict the scope to user searches only. In practice you should take steps to hide this data on user retrieval and update. Let's alter postSearchUsers 's second parameter ( results ) to ensure addresses are not leaked: for user in results . getEntries () : user . setAttribute ( \"jansAddres\" , None ) This is very straightforward code except for the usage of jansAddres . Shouldn't it be simply addresses as the known SCIM attribute? Scripts work with entities that are about to be persisted or have already been saved so they kind of resemble the database structure (schema in LDAP terms). It turns out that database attribute names rarely match with SCIM names. While it is easy to know the SCIM name of a database attribute, the converse requires checking the code, however since you already have the skill this shouldn't be a problem: in this Java class you'll find the representation of a user resource in SCIM spec terms. Pay attention to the addresses field and its associated StoreReference annotation that contains the attribute where addresses are actually stored. With that said, save your modifications. You may like the idea of adding some prints for enlightment like: print \"%d entries returned of %d\" % ( results . getEntriesCount () , results . getTotalEntriesCount ()) for user in results . getEntries () : print \"Flushing addresses for user %s\" % user . getUid () user . setAttribute ( \"jansAddres\" , None ) Ensure no addresses are returned anymore in your SCIM user searches. Happy testing!","title":"Example: Modifying Search Results"},{"location":"script-catalog/scim/#controlling-execution-of-scim-operations","text":"With the manageResourceOperation and manageSearchOperation methods you can make complex decisions on how processing should take place based on contextual data and the incoming payload. manageResourceOperation This method is invoked when any following operations are executed: resource creation, modification, removal and retrieval by ID. In case of bulks, the method is called for every operation that fits into these categories. Parameters are described in the table below: Name Description Class/Link context Provides contextual information about the SCIM operation being called such as type of resource involved, HTTP verb, request headers, query params, etc. OperationContext entity A non-null object representing the resource involved A descendant of Entry . If the resource is a user, it will be an instance of ScimCustomPerson . In case of a group, it will be a GluuGroup payload The payload sent in the invocation; null when the operation is removal or retrieval by ID The datatype depends on the operation called. Check the interface that suits best and inspect the first parameter's datatype. The class will belong to some subpackage inside io.jans.scim.model.scim2 This method is expected to return an instance of javax.ws.rs.core.Response that supersedes the output of the operation itself. In other words, the actual processing of the operation is skipped in favor of the code supplied here. However note that minor validations may take place in the payload before your code is actually called. Returning None transfers the control of the operation for normal processing (default Jans implementation). If the method execution crashes at runtime, a 500 HTTP error is sent. Notes: Possible values for context.getResourceType() are: User, Group, FidoDevice, Fido2Device context.getTokenDetails().getValue() is a shortcut that will give you the access token the caller employed to issue the service call Both context.getTokenDetails().getTokenType() and context.getTokenDetails().getScope() return non null values when the protection mechanism of the API is OAuth or test mode Note that for resource creation operation, entity basically contains the same data supplied in the POST payload . In this case, entity has not originated from the database and has not been persisted either For the case of modification, retrieval and removal, entity contains the data currently stored in the database for the resource in question Since many values come from Java code, you can always do getClass().getName() to get an idea of what type of variables you are dealing with To build custom error responses your can reuse some of the getErrorResponse methods of class BaseScimWebService This method offers a high degree of flexibility. Perform careful testing of your code and account all potential scenarios. manageSearchOperation This method is invoked when resource searches are performed. Parameters are described in the table below: name Description Class/Link context Provides contextual information about the SCIM operation being called such as type of resource involved, HTTP verb, request headers, query params, etc. OperationContext searchRequest An object representing the search parameters provided in the call (applies for both GET and POST) SearchRequest Unlike manageResourceOperation , no entity parameter is passed. This is so because making decisions based on already executed searches would have a performance impact. Instead you can use context.setFilterPrepend(...) to help restrict the search against the database: here you can pass a String value that will be interpreted as an SCIM filter expression (see section 3.4.2.2 of RFC 7644). When the search being performed already contains a search filter (i.e. searchRequest.getFilter() is non-empty), a new filter is created by appending both \"subfilters\" with an and operator. As in the case of manageResourceOperation this method is expected to return an instance of javax.ws.rs.core.Response . Returning None transfers the control of the operation for normal processing (the Jans implementation). If the method execution crashes at runtime, a 500 HTTP error is sent. The same recommendations given for manageResourceOperation apply here. If you build filter expressions in your method, ensure they are syntactically valid to avoid your callers getting unexpected \"invalidFilter\" 400 errors. Example: segmenting the user base Let's assume you make use of the SCIM attribute userType so that your user base is partitioned into three disjoint segments according to such attribute and you have designated its possible values to be: Contractor, Employee, or Intern. Suppose your company has three different applications that make management of users in every category, that is, only one application is devoted to manage contractors, another employees, and other interns. You are interested in consistently granting access so that no application can create, query or modify users that don't belong to its focus. To properly handle this multi-tenancy scenario, you decide to use the contextual information coming from every request to determine if the operation should be allowed or not. For this purpose you communicate every application developer to send an additional HTTP header in their call with a value that only you (the administrator) and the developer knows. Let's call it the \"secret\". For the sake of simplicity let's assume developers are external to the company and only you know their identities. They don't know each other so they cannot exchange secrets. The strategy to implement segmentation is rather simple: Alter the default SCIM script by supplying a custom implementation for the methods that control execution Make the HTTP header name be a configuration property of the script so that it is not hard-coded Add a configuration property that contains the mapping of userType value vs. expected header value in JSON format Adding and parsing config properties Using Jans Config CLI update the SCIM script and add properties: custom_header with value USER-SEGMENT-SECRET access_map with value { \"<random_string>\":\"Contractor\", \"<random_string>\":\"Employee\", \"<random_string>\":\"Intern\" } Save the changes. In the init method this properties should be parsed. To start, let's add some imports: from io.jans.scim.ws.rs.scim2 import BaseScimWebService import json Here is how init would look like: def init ( self , configurationAttributes ): self . custom_header = configurationAttributes . get ( \"custom_header\" ) . getValue2 () access_map_json = configurationAttributes . get ( \"access_map\" ) . getValue2 () self . access_map = json . loads ( access_map_json ) print \"ScimEventHandler (init): Initialized successfully\" return True Note no validations took place here: we assumed the script contains the properties, that they are non empty and have sensible values. Allow/Deny resource operations The first step is to know the kind of application that is calling our service. For this purpose let's create a method that given incoming request headers returns the matching userType # headers params is an instance of javax . ws . rs . core . MultivaluedMap < String , String > def getUserType ( self , headers ) : secret = headers . getFirst ( self . custom_header ) if secret in self . access_map : return self . access_map [ secret ] else : return None Now let's code manageResourceOperation . We should allow access only under the following conditions: The getUserType method does not return None The entity object ( ScimCustomPerson instance) has a proper userType value. This means that for user creation, the incoming payload comes with a matching userType and for the other cases, the already stored attribute matches as well Assume that if the operation invoked is not user-related, we should allow access freely. Here is how the implementation might look: def manageResourceOperation ( self , context , entity , payload , configurationAttributes ): print \"manageResourceOperation. SCIM endpoint invoked is %s (HTTP %s )\" % ( context . getPath (), context . getMethod ()) if context . getResourceType () != \"User\" : return None expected_user_type = self . getUserType ( context . getRequestHeaders ()) if expected_user_type != None and entity . getAttribute ( \"jansUsrTyp\" ) == expected_user_type : return None else : return BaseScimWebService . getErrorResponse ( 403 , None , \"Attempt to handle a not allowed user type\" ) Note no usage of the payload took place. A case you may like to evaluate is where mistakenly using an update operation, the userType is set to an unexpected value. Allow/Deny searches This time instead of inspecting an entity, we ought to make a filter expression to restrict the search when the database is queried. For your reference, a valid filter expression is for instance userType eq \"Contractor\" . def manageSearchOperation ( self , context , searchRequest , configurationAttributes ) : print \"manageSearchOperation. SCIM endpoint invoked is %s (HTTP %s)\" % ( context . getPath () , context . getMethod ()) resource_type = context . getResourceType () print \"manageSearchOperation. This is a search over %s resources\" % resource_type if resource_type != \"User\" : return None expected_user_type = self . getUserType ( context . getRequestHeaders ()) if expected_user_type != None : context . setFilterPrepend ( \"userType eq \\\" % s \\ \"\" % expected_user_type ) return None else : return BaseScimWebService . getErrorResponse ( 403 , None , \"Attempt to handle a not allowed user type\" ) The manageSearchOperation must return a javax.ws.rs.core.Response .
